        "[Ordinal regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_regression) is a classification method for categories on an ordinal scale -- e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] or [G, PG, PG-13, R].  This notebook implements ordinal regression using the method of [Frank and Hal 2001](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~eibe/pubs/ordinal_tech_report.pdf), which transforms a k-multiclass classifier into k-1 binary classifiers (each of which predicts whether a data point is above a threshold in the ordinal scale -- e.g., whether a movie is \"higher\" than PG).  This method can be used with any binary classification method that outputs probabilities; here L2-regularizaed binary logistic regression is used.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook trains a model (on `train.txt`), optimizes L2 regularization strength on `dev.txt`, and evaluates performance on `test.txt`.  Reports test accuracy with 95% confidence intervals."

Based on the most widely used Köppen-Geiger scheme, this article proposes a neural network based climate classification method from a data science perspective. In conventional schemes, empirically handcrafted rules are used to divide climate data into climate types, resulting in certain defects. In the proposed method, a machine learning mechanism is employed to do the task. Specifically, the method first trains a convolutional neural network to fit climate data to land cover conditions, then extracts features from the trained network and finally uses a self-organizing map to cluster land pixels on the extracted features. The method is applied to cluster global land represented by 66,501 pixels (each covers 0.5 latitude degree × 0.5 longitude degree) using 2020 land cover data and 1991-2020 climate normals, and a 4 × 3 × 2 hexagonal self-organizing map clusters the land pixels into twenty-four climate types. By Kappa statistics, the obtained scheme shows good agreement with the Köppen-Geiger and Köppen-Trewartha schemes. In addition, our scheme addresses some issues of the Köppen schemes, suggests new climate types such as As (severe dry-wet season) and Fw (arctic desert), and identifies the highland group H without input of elevation. The proposed method is expected as an intelligent tool to monitor changes in the global climate pattern and to discover new climate types of interest that possibly emerge in the future. It may also be valuable for bio-ecology communities.\\n   \n",

Correspondingly, changes in hydrologic regimes could lead to increased drought and occurrence of wildfire. Fire management agencies require information about near-real time wildfire vulnerability in boreal peatlands. Remote sensing tools (e.g., NDVI, NDII) to monitor changing wildfire vulnerability focus on monitoring changes in vascular vegetation and are not necessarily applicable to moss-dominated peatlands. We use time series analysis of Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data to compare the trends in peatlands that have burned to unburned peatlands and show that the Theil-Sen slopes of seasonally decomposed SAR backscatter reflects prolonged drought conditions that can lead to burning. Seasonally decomposed Sentinel-2 NDVI and NDII were also tested but no statistical differences were found between burned and unburned peatlands. Overall, we found that 6 months prior to a wildfire the slope of seasonally decomposed Sentinel-1 VV SAR backscatter was significantly different in burned and unburned peatlands, and can be used to spatially identify fire vulnerability and identify fire-prone areas.\\n   \n",

Passive microwave remote sensing allows estimating carbon from deep canopy layers through the Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) parameter. Although their spatial resolution is coarser than that of optical vegetation indices or airborne Lidar data, microwaves present a higher penetration capacity at low frequencies (Lband) and avoid cloud masking. This work compares the relationships of airborne carbon maps in Central and South America with both (i) SMAP L-band VOD at 9 km gridding and (ii) MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Models to estimate carbon stocks are built from these two satellite derived variables. Results show that L-band VOD has a greater capacity to model carbon variability than EVI. The resulting VOD-derived carbon estimates are further presented at a detailed (9 km) spatial scale.\\n   \n",

Although the basic science showing that CO2 would absorb the infrared radiation emitted by the earth produce a surface-warming effect was first calculated by Arrhenius in 1896, the issue was neglected by the scientific community for decades. Today there are ample climate models of the climactic effects arising from the forcing term of increasing P[CO2]. In this paper we follow Arrhenius’ concept, although we use the HITRAN database as the input to prove the connection between earth’s surface temperature and atmospheric absorption of terrestrial radiation in a direct manner that the reader can also implement. The spectra of CO2 are enormously complicated, broadened by Fermi Resonance, and intense because of the quantum coupling of the rotation of CO2 to its bending. Using an on-line database for the transitions of CO2 the reader will easily be able to show that CO2 reduces the transmittance of the Earth’s thermal radiation through the atmosphere, which in turn results in heating of the surface. The model does not make any predictions other than that the global temperature will increase as a function of P[CO2]. The result is at the intersection of Physics, Atmospheric Science, and Psychology since the demonstration is a powerful tool that will give scientists the impetus to reach out to the public with lucid explanations based on physical principles.\\n   \n",

These microbes reduce surface albedo, which, in turn, could lead to warming and enhanced glacier melt. Here we present results from a replicated, controlled field experiment to quantify the impact of microbes on snowmelt in red-snow communities. Addition of nitrogen‚Äìphosphorous‚Äìpotassium fertilizer increased alga cell counts nearly fourfold, to levels similar to nitrogen‚Äìphosphorus-enriched lakes; water alone increased counts by half. The manipulated alga abundance explained a third of the observed variability in snowmelt. Using a normalized-difference spectral index we estimated alga abundance from satellite imagery and calculated microbial contribution to snowmelt on an icefield of 1,900 km2. The red-snow area extended over about 700 km2, and in this area we determined that microbial communities were responsible for 17% of the total snowmelt there. Our results support hypotheses that snow-dwelling microbes increase glacier melt directly in a bio-geophysical feedback by lowering albedo and indirectly by exposing low-albedo glacier ice. Radiative forcing due to perennial populations of microbes may match that of non-living particulates at high latitudes. Their contribution to climate warming is likely to grow with increased melt and nutrient input.\\n   \n",

This paper outlines an environmental flow assessment methodology that explicitly addresses the uncertainty and change inherent in adaptively managing multiple values for management of environmental flows. While non-stationarity and uncertainty are well recognised in the climate literature, these have not been addressed within the structure of environmental flows methodologies. Here, we present an environmental flow assessment that is structured to explicitly consider future change and uncertainty in climate and socio-ecological values, by examining scenarios using ecological models. The environmental flow assessment methodology further supports adaptive management through the intentional integration of participatory approaches and the inclusion of diverse stakeholders. We present a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, highlighting how this methodology facilitates adaptive management. Rethinking our approach to environmental flows assessments is an important step in ensuring that environmental flows continue to work effectively as a management tool under climate change.\\n   \n",

To better address the ramifications of those hazards, now and into the future, the UK needs to transform its scattered, fragmented coastal data resources into a systematic, integrated, quality-controlled, openly accessible data portal. Such a portal would support analyses of coastal risk and resilience by hosting, in addition to data layers for coastal flooding and erosion, a diverse array of spatial datasets for building footprints, infrastructure networks, land use, population, and various socio-economic measures and indicators derived from survey and census data. Rather than prescribe user engagement, the portal would facilitate novel combinations of spatial data layers in order to yield scientifically, societally, and economically beneficial insights into UK coastal systems.\\n   \n",

A record-breaking gigafire event ravaged the western United States (USA) in mid-September 2020, burning 1.2 million acres (4,900 km2) in Oregon and California, and resulting in severe smoke pollution with daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations over 300 ¬µg/m3 for multiple days in many cities. Although previous studies have shown that regional warming escalates wildfire in the western USA, such an unprecedented fire cannot be explained by climate variability alone. Here we show that the synoptic-scale feedback between the wildfires and weather played an unexpectedly important role in accelerating the spread of this fire and also trapped pollutants in the shallow boundary layer over valley cities. Specifically, we find that aerosol-radiation interaction of the smoke plumes over the Cascade Mountains enhanced the downslope winds and weakened the moisture transport, thereby forming a positive feedback loop that amplified the fires and contributed to ~54% of estimated air-pollution related deaths. Our study underscores the complexity of the Earth system and the importance of understanding fundamental mechanisms to effectively mitigate disaster risks in a changing climate.\\n   \n",

Here the authors quantify the conditional relationships between precursor SST and SLP variables and localized extremes of CAPE and shear associated with large outbreaks. They do this by fitting linear regressions to global climate variables averaged over the fifteen days before the outbreak to estimate the changes in CAPE and shear on days with at least ten tornadoes. Results show that for every 1¬∞ increase in the SST gradient between the Gulf of Alaska and the Caribbean, DLBS increases by 0.88 m s¬Ø¬π, SLBS increases by 0.62 m s¬Ø¬π, and CAPE decreases by 50.6 J kg¬Ø¬π, conditional on at least ten tornadoes, and holding the other variables constant. Further, results show that for every 1¬∞ E increase in longitude, DLBS increases by 0.15 m s¬Ø¬π, SLBS increases by 0.38 m s¬Ø¬π, and CAPE decreases by 39.3 J kg¬Ø¬π, conditional on at least ten tornadoes, and holding the other variables constant. Additionally, SLBS is the only environmental factor that has a significant upward annual trend.\\n   \n",

However, none of the current commensuration approaches are suitable for addressing the current climatic effect of mire ecosystems as compared to the situation in which such mires would not exist. The mire ecosystems have accumulated carbon for millennia, creating a negative perturbation to the atmospheric carbon dioxide content, but at the same time they emit methane into the atmosphere. Thus, the functioning of mires involves GHG fluxes with opposing effects on Earth’s radiative balance. Here, based on a simple radiative forcing (RF) model, we propose a new metric for commensuration of the effects of accumulated carbon and methane emission (ACME) on Earth’s energy balance. This ACME approach is applicable to natural mires with a significant part of their carbon accumulated more than 1000 years ago and requires relatively few input data. We demonstrate the feasibility of the ACME approach by applying it to a set of northern mires. The ACME-based RF estimate indicates that these mires have a cooling effect on the current climate, contrary to what a global warming potential-based calculation suggests, since the climatic effect is dominated by the sustained carbon accumulation. By applying the new metric with varying estimates of the total carbon storage and methane emission of northern mires, we estimate the current RF of these mires to range from –0.45 to –0.23 W m-2.\\n   \n",

Lithium brine processing requires freshwater, so as lithium exploration increases, accurate estimates of freshwater availability are critical for water management decisions in this region with limited water resources. Here we calculate modern freshwater inflows, such as groundwater recharge and streamflow, for 28 active or prospective lithium-producing basins. We use regional water budget assessments, field streamflow measurements, and global climate and groundwater recharge datasets. Using the freshwater inflow estimates, we calculate water scarcity using the Available Water Remaining methodology. Among all 28 basins, freshwater inflows range from 2 to 33‚Äâmm per year. Our results reveal that commonly used global hydrologic models overestimate streamflow and freshwater availability substantially, leading to inaccurate water scarcity classifications.\\n   \n",

While public and private sector funding is vital, philanthropy offers unique opportunities to support localized, innovative climate solutions. This review explores the current climate finance landscape, identifies the specific needs of Atlantic Canadian communities, and evaluates how philanthropic funding can bridge gaps in financing. It focuses on the impact of philanthropy on climate adaptation and mitigation efforts, emphasizing community resilience and sustainability. While philanthropy can drive positive change, challenges such as equitable resource distribution, fostering systemic change, and empowering marginalized communities must be addressed. Philanthropic organizations should transition from providing short-term, project-focused funding to supporting long-term, transformative initiatives. Collaborative partnerships between governments, businesses, and civil society are key to maximizing impact. Addressing these challenges and embracing innovative approaches will enable philanthropy to serve as a powerful catalyst for climate action, fostering a more environmentally stable future and able to withstand climate challenges for Atlantic Canada and beyond.\\n   \n",

Here we build a unified theoretical framework to describe BC’s mixing states, linking dynamic processes to BC coating thickness distribution, and show its self-similarity for sites in diverse environments. The size distribution of BC-containing particles is found to follow an exponential pattern and is independent of BC core size. A mixing state module is established based on this finding and successfully applied in global and regional models, which increases the accuracy of aerosol climate effect estimations. Our theoretical framework can bridge the gap between observation and model simulation in both mixing state description and light absorption quantification.\\n   \n",

In particular, CWS can provide long-term measurements of urban heat and valuable information on spatio-temporal heterogeneity related to horizontal heat advection. In this study, we make the first compilation of a quasi-climatologic dataset covering 6 years (2015–2020) of hourly near-surface air temperature measurements obtained via 1560 suitable CWS in a domain covering south-east England and Greater London. We investigated the spatio- temporal distribution of urban heat and the influences of local environments on climate, captured by CWS through the scope of Local Climate Zones (LCZ) – a land-use land-cover classification specifically designed for urban climate studies. We further calculate, for the first time, the amount of advected heat captured by CWS located in Greater London and the wider south east England region. We find that London is on average warmer by ∼1.0 ◦C to ∼2.0 ◦C than the rest of south-east England. Characteristics of the southern coastal climate are also captured in the analysis. We find that on average, urban heat advection (UHA) contributes to 0.22 ◦C of the total urban heat in Greater London. Certain areas, mostly in the centre of London are deprived of urban heat through advection since heat is transferred more to downwind suburban areas. UHA can positively contribute to urban heat by up to ∼2.0 ◦C on average and negatively by down to ∼-1.0 ◦C. Our results also show an important degree of inter- and intra-LCZ variability in UHA, calling for more research in the future. Nevertheless, we already find that UHA can impact green areas and reduce their cooling benefit. Such outcomes show the added value of CWS for future urban design.\\n   \n",

Rising sea levels and increasingly severe weather events endanger coastlines across Canada, a nation with over 243,000 km of coastline. Indigenous communities, with their long history of coastal resource utilization, are especially vulnerable. This study investigates the social, economic, and environmental impacts of coastal erosion and flooding in Channel-Port aux Basques, Newfoundland. Hurricane Fiona’s devastating impact on the community in 2022 underscores the urgency of adaptation strategies. The research employed a multi-pronged approach: data analysis from weather and census sources, a literature review, a vulnerability assessment using established frameworks, and agent-based modeling using NetLogo software. Findings reveal significant social impacts, including displacement, emotional distress, and loss of public spaces. While existing adaptation measures like shoreline armoring offer some protection, their effectiveness in the face of stronger storms and projected sea level rise remains questionable. The agent-based model predicts increased coastal erosion, with households within 8 meters experiencing erosion within the first year at current sea level rise rates. The study recommends developing a comprehensive plan to mitigate coastal erosion risks. Potential solutions include sea walls and promoting sustainable land-use practices that prioritize coastal ecosystems and managed retreat strategies. The research concludes by emphasizing the need for context-specific, participatory adaptation strategies to enhance coastal community resilience in the face of a changing climate.\\n   \n",

Different zonal wind stress anomalies are employed, and their intensity is strengthened or weakened with respect to the climatological value throughout a suite of simulations.   Strengthened (weakened) zonal wind stress anomalies result in increased (decreased) STCs meridional mass and energy transport. Upwelling of subsurface water into the tropics is intensified (reduced), a distinct cold (warm) anomaly appears in the equatorial thermocline and up to the surface, resulting in significant tropical sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies.   Results hold for both subtropical and extratropical anomalies, suggesting the potential impact of mid-latitude atmospheric modes of variability on tropical climate.  Finally, the remotely-driven response is compared with a set of locally-forced simulations, where an equatorial zonal wind stress anomaly is imposed. A dynamically distinct response is achieved, whereby the equatorial thermocline adjusts to the wind stress anomaly resulting in significant equatorial SST anomalies as in the remotely-forced simulations. Significant anomalies in the Indonesian throughflow are generated only when equatorial wind stress anomalies are applied, leading to remarkable heat content anomalies in the Indian Ocean.  Equatorial wind stress anomalies experiments do not involve modifications of STC transports, but could set up the appropriate initial conditions for a tropical-extratropical teleconnection, involving both Hadley cells and STC anomalous transports.\\n   \n",

This article posits that selective science communication and unrealistically optimistic assumptions are obscuring the reality that greenhouse gas emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal will not curtail climate change in the 21st Century. It also explains how overly pessimistic and speculative criticisms are behind opposition to considering potential climate cooling interventions as a complementary approach for mitigating dangerous warming.  There is little evidence supporting assertions that: current greenhouse gas emissions reduction and removal methods can and will be ramped up in time to prevent dangerous climate change; overshoot of Paris Agreement targets will be temporary; net zero emissions will produce a safe, stable climate; the impacts of overshoot can be managed and reversed; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change models and assessments capture the full scope of prospective disastrous impacts; and the risks of climate interventions are greater than the risks of inaction.  These largely unsupported presumptions distort risk assessments and discount the urgent need to develop a viable mitigation strategy. Due to political pressures, many critical scientific concerns are ignored or preemptively dismissed in international negotiations. As a result, the present and growing crisis and the level of effort and time that will be required to control and rebalance the climate are severely underestimated.  In conclusion, the paper outlines the key elements of a realistic policy approach that would augment current efforts to constrain dangerous warming by supplementing current mitigation approaches with climate cooling interventions.\\n   \n",

Despite gaining popularity, studies of various stochastic subgrid scale parameterizations applied to atmospheric climate and weather prediction systems have revealed a diversity of model responses, including degeneracy in the response to different forcings and compensating model errors, with little reduction in artificial damping of the small scales required for numerical stability. Due to the greater range of spatio-temporal scales involved, how to best sample subgrid fluctuations in a computationally inexpensive manner, with the aim of reduced model error and improvements to the simulated climatological state of the ocean, remains an open question. While previous studies have considered perturbations to the surface forcing or subsurface temperature tendencies, we implement an energetically consistent, simple, stochastic subgrid eddy parameterization of the momentum fluxes in regions of the three-dimensional ocean typically associated with high eddy variability.  We consider the changes in the modelled energetics of low-resolution simulations in response to stochastically forced velocity tendencies whose perturbation statistics and amplitudes are calculated from an eddy resolving ocean configuration. Kinetic energy spectra from a triple-decomposition reveal a systematic redistribution from the seasonal (climatological minus mean) potential energy to preferentially generate small scale transient kinetic energy while the total energy spectra remains largely unchanged. We show that stochastic parameterization generally improves model biases, noticeably so for the simulated energetics of the Southern Oceans.\\n   \n",

We analyze one authoritative Pleistocene data set to explore how the climate sensitivity parameter S varies under different system states, using linear regression of mean annual surface temperature changes against CO2 forcing changes.  On the whole data set, S = 2.04K/Wm^(-2) and CO2 forcing explains 64% of the variance in temperature.  Partitioning the data by path (glaciation / de-glaciation); during de-glaciation episodes, S = 2.34K/Wm^(-2), explaining 75% of the temperature variance; during glaciations, S = 1.59K/Wm^(-2) explaining 48% of the temperature variance. Further partitioning into epochs before and after the Marine Isotope Stage 11 424 kaBP (thousand years before present); for de-glaciation paths after 424 kaBP, S = 2.63 K/Wm^(-2) explaining 83% of the variance.  Partitioning into levels of CO2 concentration has much less explanatory power; 20% for concentrations above 210 ppmv and 2% for concentrations below 210 ppmv. These partitions conflate glaciation and de-glaciation episodes and pre/post 424 kaBP epochs.  Possible process-related explanations for the path-related differences are conjectured.  The common assumption that changes in temperature are proportional to changes in CO2 forcing constrains the regression intercept to pass through the origin and inflates the regression error to the extent that the regression model becomes a worse predictor of temperature changes than simply predicting the population mean for all values of CO2 forcing. The consequences of this assumption are substantive in the context of estimating future temperature trajectories and should be carefully weighed.\\n   \n",

Accelerating research on this topic is critical in view of rapid climate change driven by anthropogenic activities. Over the last two decades, we have improved our understanding of how mass distribution on the Earth‚Äôs surface, in particular changes in ice and water distribution linked to glacial cycles, affects mantle melting, crustal magmatic processing and eruption rates. New hypotheses on the impacts of climate change on eruption processes have also emerged, including how eruption style and volcanic plume rise are affected by changing surface and atmospheric conditions, and how volcanic sulfate aerosol lifecycle, radiative forcing and climate impacts are modulated by background climate conditions. Future improvements in past climate reconstructions and current climate observations, volcanic eruption records and volcano monitoring, and numerical models will contribute to boost research on climate-volcano impacts. Important mechanisms remain to be explored, such as how changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation will affect the volcanic ash lifecycle. Fostering a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to climate-volcano impacts is critical to gain a full picture of how ongoing climate changes may affect the environmental and societal impacts of volcanic activity.\\n   \n",

Since in the last few decades in many regions, nutrients in lakes were reduced simultaneously as the climate changed. Yet, it remains unclear which of the two has impacted primary production the most. In this study, we couple the General Ocean Turbulence Model with the Ecological Regional Ocean Model to disentangle the effects of climate change and reoligotrophication on primary production (PP) in Lake Geneva, Switzerland-France. We apply a data assimilation method to calibrate the model with the observations from the past (1981-1990) and validate it against the in-situ data from the present decade (2011-2019). Both decades represent different climate conditions and trophic states of the lake. We show that the model is skilful to reproduce assimilated and unassimilated observations from both periods. According to our results, the effect of reoligotrophication on PP is marginally higher than that of warming, leading to a net decrease in primary production by 10% from the past to the present. The areal phosphorus supply in Lake Geneva, in spite of a decrease by 70%, is still characteristic of a meso-to-eutrophic ecosystem. This points towards an incomplete reoligotrophication of the lake. The effects of future climate change on winter mixing and PP dynamics have also been studied. Although there would be a significant reduction in deep mixing, the autotrophic production in Lake Geneva is expected to increase by 20% by the end of 21st century, largely due to stimulation in biomass build-up of temperature-dependent algae (e.g. dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria). Considering our results to represent other large temperate lakes with similar trophic status and water residence time as Lake Geneva, future climate scenarios are expected to bring back symptoms of eutrophication.\\n   \n",

One arising technique is the use of machine-learning (ML) models. In this study we explore its opportunities to project sub-national armed conflict risk for three shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) scenarios and three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) by 2040-2050 in Africa, using the novel and open-source ML framework CoPro. Results are consistent with the underlying socio-economic storylines of the SSPs, and the resulting out-of-sample armed conflict projections obtained with RandomForest classifiers agree with comparable studies. In SSP1-RCP2.6, conflict risk is low or absent in most regions, although the Horn of Africa and parts of Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique continue to be conflict-prone. Conflict risk intensifies in the more severe SSP3-RCP6.0 scenario, especially in central Africa and large parts of western Africa. We specifically assessed the role of hydro-climatic indicators as drivers of armed conflict. Overall, their importance is limited but can differ locally depending on the overall sign of climate change impact and the contextual (socio-economic) factors defining the overall magnitude of those impacts. With our study being at the forefront of ML applications for conflict risk projections, we have identified various challenges for this arising scientific field. A major concern is the inconsistent data availability of observed conflict events as well as of socio-economic indicators for the various SSPs. Nevertheless, ML models such as the one presented here are a viable way forward in the field of armed conflict risk projections, and can help to inform the policy-making process with respect to climate security.\\n   \n",

This new system retains the simplicity and interpretability of existing classifications, such as those of Köppen-Geiger and Trewartha, while providing an improved fit to biome boundaries. Unlike previous classifications, we developed our system by analyzing contemporary climate and land cover datasets. Our classification focuses on temperature, but it is designed so that future analyses could combine our results with precipitation criteria from new or existing systems to offer a more comprehensive climate classification framework.\\n   \n",

The computer model environment allows us to strictly control for variables such as sea surface temperature (SST), foraminifera species abundance response to SST, as well as depositional processes such as sediment accumulation rate (SAR) and bioturbation depth (BD), and subsequent laboratory processes such as sample size and machine error. Examining a number of best-case scenarios, we find that IFA-derived reconstructions of past SST variability are sensitive to all of the aforementioned variables. Running 100 ensembles for each scenario, we find that the influence of bioturbation upon IFA-derived SST reconstructions, combined with typical samples sizes employed in the field, produces noisy SST reconstructions with poor correlation to the original SST distribution in the water. This noise is especially apparent for values near the edge of the SST distribution, which is the distribution region of particular interest for, e.g., ENSO. The noise is further increased in the case of increasing machine error, decreasing SAR and decreasing sample size. We also find poor agreement between ensembles, underscoring the need for replication studies in the field to confirm findings at particular sites and time periods. Furthermore, we show that a species‚Äô abundance response to SST could in theory bias IFA-derived SST reconstructions, which can have consequences when comparing IFA-derived SST from markedly different mean climate states. We provide a number of idealised simulations spanning a number of SAR, sample size, machine error and species abundance scenarios, which can help assist researchers in the field to determine under which conditions they could expect to retrieve significant results.\\n   \n",

With concern over the potential for a change in water availability to impact communities and ecosystems across the region, an understanding of historical trends in precipitation is required to aid model development and assess the vulnerability of the region to future changes in the hydroclimate. Here we present a record from Lake Baikal, located in the southern Siberian region of central Asia close to the Mongolian border, which demonstrates a relationship between the oxygen isotope composition of diatom silica (δ18Odiatom) and precipitation to the region over the 20th and 21st Century. From this, we suggest that annual rates of precipitation in recent times are at their lowest for the past 10,000 years and identify significant long-term variations in precipitation throughout the early to late Holocene interval. Based on comparisons to other regional records, these trends are suggested to reflect conditions across the wider Central Asian region around Lake Baikal and highlight the potential for further changes in precipitation with future climate change.\\n   \n",

Spatially explicit economic models usually describe human activities and ensuing land-use dynamics at a resolution that this is too coarse (typically 10-1000 regions) to understand how these affect many biophysical processes, including ecosystem service supply (which requires billions of 300m or finer grid-cells). Several land-use change models exist that allocate coarse land-use changes at finer spatial scales, but there is no general, global, computationally tractable tool for downscaling to the spatial scale appropriate for understanding landscape and ecosystem change across different land-system scenarios. Here, we present a new model, the Spatial Economic Allocation Landscape Simulator (SEALS), which generates global, high resolution land-use, land-cover maps from coarse projections of land-use change. SEALS advances land-use change modeling research in several ways: it uses a novel machine-learning algorithm to empirically calibrate its parameters; it is a generalized approach that can be applied to very different types of projections within earth-economy models; and it is computationally efficient, generating global results at 300m resolution in approximately 1 hour on a laptop computer. We develop SEALS, and apply it to downscale 6 global scenarios of land-use change from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to 300m resolution, which we make publicly available, allowing researchers to project global, fine-scale changes in ecosystem services. For carbon storage and sequestration, we find that, from 2021 to 2100, the SSPs considered result in reductions in carbon storage and sequestration by 3-21%, and baseline results are 9.17% lower than conventional estimates using low-resolution inputs. Consistent with prior estimates, we find that SSPs 3 and 4, which lead to large amounts of tropical deforestation, result in the largest carbon losses, further exacerbating the climate impacts.\\n   \n",

At remote lake-rich landscapes, ability to implement and maintain long-term monitoring is often challenged by logistical and financial constraints. At the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD; northeastern Alberta, Canada), an internationally recognized remote freshwater landscape threatened by climate change and upstream industrial development (hydroelectric regulation of river flow, oil sands mining and processing), the need for an integrated aquatic ecosystem monitoring program has long been recognized to track changes to the flood regime, water balance, water quality, and contaminant deposition in the abundant shallow lakes. The remoteness and hydrological complexity of the landscape, among other factors, have hindered the implementation of such a program. In recent years, concern over aquatic ecosystem degradation has led to renewed and urgent calls by international and national governance agencies for implementation of a long-term monitoring program. Here, we report on intensive, multi-faceted research performed during 2015-2021 at 60 lakes spanning the delta’s broad hydroecological gradients to develop, evaluate, and apply a framework for integrated assessment of status and trends in water balance, water chemistry and contaminant enrichment. We present the design and approaches used, synthesize the knowledge gained from data collected during the 7-year-long research phase, and provide a foundation for a long-term aquatic ecosystem monitoring program that addresses several recommendations stemming from assessments by UNESCO and key priorities within the Wood Buffalo National Park Action Plan. We suggest the monitoring framework is readily transferable to other remote shallow lake- and pond-rich landscapes threatened by multiple potential stressors.\\n   \n",

However, in the Southwestern United States there is discord between these two types of information: proxy data have been interpreted to indicate much wetter conditions, while the most recent generation of mid-Pliocene warm period climate models simulates drying. We use a water and energy balance framework to directly compare paleoclimate model output to a refined compilation of proxy records of the presence and areal extent of mid-Pliocene lakes. Within this framework, we quantify uncertainties in the proxy system model parameters and in the interpretation of available proxy records. We find that despite these significant uncertainties, most paleoclimate models simulate a regional balance between precipitation and evaporative demand that could not have sustained the extent of recorded lakes from this time. Moreover, the extensive lakes included as boundary conditions in mid-Pliocene warm period climate models are inconsistent with the regional climate simulated by those same models. This study identifies and quantifies the remaining unknowns in our picture of regional mid-Pliocene warm period hydroclimate, with implications for analyses of climate dynamics during this time.\\n   \n",

We elicit judgements on natural science research priorities for solar geoengineering through a survey and in-person discussion with 72 subject matter experts, including two thirds of all scientists with ‚â•10 publications on the topic. Experts prioritized Earth system response (33%) and impacts on society and ecosystems (27%) over the human and social dimensions (17%) and developing or improving solar geoengineering methods (15%), with most allocating no effort to weather control or counter-geoengineering. While almost all funding to date has focused on geophysical modeling and social sciences, our experts recommended substantial funding for observations (26%), perturbative field experiments (16%), laboratory research (11%) and engineering for deployment (11%). Of the specific proposals, stratospheric aerosols received the highest average priority (34%) then marine cloud brightening (17%) and cirrus cloud thinning (10%). The views of experts with ‚â•10 publications were generally consistent with experts with <10 publications, though when asked to choose the radiative forcing for their ideal climate scenario only 40% included solar geoengineering compared to 70% of experts with <10 publications. This suggests that those who have done more solar geoengineering research are less supportive of its use in climate policy. We summarize specific research recommendations and challenges that our experts identified, the most salient of which were fundamental uncertainties around key climate processes, novel challenges related to solar geoengineering as a design problem, and the challenges of public and policymaker engagement.\\n   \n",

In contrast, the few existing terrestrial records demonstrate high heterogeneity of environmental change and are difficult to reconcile with those of the oceanic realm. Global drivers for climatic change are particularly difficult to disentangle from regional ones, especially those caused by the complex tectonic evolution of the Tibetan region and its influence on the Asian monsoon system and vegetation. Here, we reconstruct the climatic and environmental history from the late Eocene into the early Oligocene at L√ºhe Basin, Yunnan, China, a key sedimentary repository along the SE margin of the Tibetan Plateau and an important region for assessing Asian monsoon changes. We investigate a 340-m long section via a multi-proxy approach and climate model simulations. The organic geochemical proxies, via n-alkanes, terpenoids, and hopanes, suggest that thermally immature sediments were deposited in a terrestrial flood plain basin that was primarily occupied by gymnosperms and angiosperms. Branched glycerol diakyl glycerol tetraethers indicate relatively stable temperatures (ca. 10 ¬∞C) throughout the section, including across the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. This temperature, cooler than the modern-day average for this site (ca. 15 ¬∞C), suggests that this area has not undergone significant uplift since the Oligocene. To further contextualize our data, we tested a suite of climate model simulations with varying pCO2, paleogeography, and Tibetan topography across the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. This data-model comparison suggests that a response to regional factors might explain the absence of a pronounced cooling at L√ºhe across the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, supporting the emerging picture that the global expression of the EOT in terrestrial environments is more complex than indicated by the marine record.\\n   \n",
              "61  Climate change influences both average states and extremes in temperatures and precipitation. Southeast Asia, one of the most vulnerable regions worldwide to floods and heatwaves, indicates an escalation of the possibility of severe climate extremes. Extreme precipitation events can bring increasing floods, leading to considerable damage to property and human well-being. However, droughts also occur in Southeast Asia due to changing precipitation patterns in different regions. In big cities, such damages and risks are highly influential, given the large population density and the proximity to the coast or rivers. Global Earth system models predict the average trends and extremes of the climate system, including record-shattering extreme events that have exceeded previous records. I use the recently released Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), a multi-model large ensemble of climate predictions under different scenarios, to investigate changes in climate conditions in ten highly populated Southeast Asian cities. I first evaluated the CMIP6 simulations in the present day (2005-2014) in the ten cities and found good consistency in temperature and precipitation. Then, I examine changes in the mean, minimum, and maximum temperature and precipitation on an annual, monthly, and daily basis, respectively, under the high-emission SSP5-8.5 scenario. Furthermore, in the late century, annual maximum temperatures hit more than 40 °C in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and Vientiane. Cities in our study are projected to experience 5-6 °C increases in temperature from November to April, indicating significant changes in the seasonal cycle. Precipitation increases significantly from May to October in most large cities in our study, except for Johor Bahru, Malaysia, where some summer precipitation reductions are expected. Yangon, in particular, is projected to increase more than 4 millimeters per day in July, indicating a very high challenge from flooding as a city facing flood risk every year at present. In summary, our results indicate significant changes in the mean and extreme states of temperature and precipitations in Southeast Asia. Based on these, I identified major physical risks of climate change among the ten cities. Decision-makers should build resilience to these risks to avoid significant damage. Yukiko Hirabayashi et al. (2013) discovered that the risks of floods increase due to the degree of warming. Increasing floods might lead to damage to households and other organisms. Moreover, a greater incidence of climate change, such as droughts, in Southeast Asia is caused by decreasing precipitation in regions (Teerachai Amnuaylojaroen and Pavinee Chanvichit (2019)). This investigation particularly utilizes CMIP6 model simulations to predict the future pattern of climate extremes based on historical and present statistics. CMIP6 performs well in reproducing the climatological spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation, with better performance for temperature than precipitation to predict near future and future climate extremes is that it (Yang et al. for China). With large-ensemble data for climate extremes, CMIP6 can predict more precise climate extremes. This model is necessary for research about extreme climate, as it addresses the climate system's natural variability in different regions with different topographic features.\\n   \n",

As gender roles, culture, age, physical and physiological characteristics increase, mainly Nepalese women's and children's, health risks associated with climate change and air pollution, listening to and learning from women is critical. This study explores women's perspectives and lived experiences concerning climate change, consequent adverse impacts on agriculture and health, and ongoing adaptation and mitigation strategies. Assessing perspectives and lived experiences related to climate change can offer opportunities to explore understanding, local beliefs, experiences with adverse impacts and adaptation. We used a descriptive qualitative approach. An equal number of focus group discussions (FGDs, n=8) and key-informant interviews (KIIs, n=8) were conducted. Purposive and snowball sampling were used to recruit participants. Four research assistants with public health backgrounds and climate change training were employed to assist with this work. All interviews were conducted in the Nepali language using an interview guide. All KIIs and FGDs were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim in Nepali. Data were analyzed in NVivo 1.7 using content analysis. Forty-two of the 48 participants identified as women. The largest proportion of participants was aged greater than or equal to 50 years (18/48), had no formal education (21/48), and were either older women (>55 years) (13/48) or mothers of children younger than five (11/48). Three main topical areas emerged from the FGDs and KIIs: (i) the winds of change, (ii) the unpredictability of weather, and (iii) acting locally. The study provides insights into how women and children in rural communities in a Nepali hill district experience, adapt and mitigate climate change impacts. These findings can help inform the development of interventions to better address women's and children's needs and concerns, essential to promoting well-being and reducing impacts exacerbated by climate change.\\n   \n",

However, lack of confidence in geologic CO2 storage security remains a barrier to CCS implementation. Here we present a numerical program that calculates CO2 storage security and leakage to the atmosphere over 10,000 years. This combines quantitative estimates of geological subsurface CO2 retention, and of surface CO2 leakage. We calculate that realistically well-regulated storage in regions with moderate well densities has a 50% probability that leakage remains below 0.0008% per year, with over 98% of the injected CO2 retained in the subsurface over 10,000 years. An unrealistic scenario, where CO2 storage is inadequately regulated, estimates that more than 78% will be retained over 10,000 years. Our modelling results suggest that geological storage of CO2 can be a secure climate change mitigation option, but we note that long-term behaviour of CO2 in the subsurface remains a key uncertainty.\\n   \n",

However, the impact of changes in precipitation amount and distribution on future glacier change remains uncertain because mesoscale meteorology is not represented in current models that project glacier change. We explored the combined effects of past and future changes in air temperature and precipitation amount and distribution on the evolution of Khumbu Glacier in the Everest region of Nepal—a benchmark glacier in the monsoon-influenced Nepal Himalaya—using a climate-glacier modelling approach that forces an ice-dynamical glacier evolution model with a surface mass balance forcing that includes mesoscale meteorological variables derived from downscaling of Regional Climate Model outputs. Our simulations show that historical warming during the late Holocene has committed Khumbu Glacier to future volume loss of 10–23% during this century. Under moderate future warming (RCP4.5) from the present day, Khumbu Glacier could lose 70% volume by 2100 CE due to increasing air temperatures. However, the projected increase in precipitation in tandem with climate warming could offset half of this loss, such that the total decrease in glacier volume by 2100 CE compared to the present day is only 34%. Extreme future warming (RCP8.5) will not be compensated by  changes in precipitation but will instead result in substantial ablation above 6,000 m, causing the highest glacier on Earth to vanish between 2160–2260 CE.\\n   \n",

CORDEX Africa has been developed to forecast Africa's climate variation and variabilities. the RCA4 regional climate model performance of CORDEX Africa domains have not been evaluated yet. Therefore, this finding is aimed to evaluate RCA4 CORDEX Africa RCMs performance in the Gilgal Gibe Watershed, Omo basin, Ethiopia. The observed rainfall and temperature data for five stations obtained from National Metrological Agent were used for bias correction of the RCMs. First the accuracy of simulation results was evaluated using as suite of statistical measures such as Bias, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient, and the result was found that the performance of model is satisfactory.

The most common method for determining spatial wind speed patterns in cities relies on numerical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, which resolve Navier-Stokes equations around buildings. While effective, these simulations are computationally intensive and require specialised expertise, limiting their broader applicability. To address these limitations, this study proposes a more cost-effective alternative while maintaining the accuracy and spatial patterns captured by CFD. We developed a machine learning (ML) approach to predict wind speed patterns from prevailing wind directions and three- dimensional urban morphology, which are increasingly available for global cities. The model is trained and tested using a comprehensive dataset of 512 numerical simulations of urban neighbourhoods, representing diverse morphological configurations in cities worldwide. We find that the ML algorithm accurately predicts complex wind patterns, achieving a normalised mean absolute error of less than 10%, which is comparable to wind anemometer measurement in a low wind speed environment. In predicting wind statistics, the ML model also surpasses that of regression models based solely on statistical representations of urban morphology. The R2 values measuring grid-level agreement between ML and CFD range from 0.94-0.99 and 0.65-0.95, respectively, for the idealised and whole datasets. However, we find that grid-based R2 is not an effective metric for evaluating the 2D model performance due to localised biases arising from faster wind speed grid regions, which is revealed by the wind probability density function. This further confirms the suitability of the ML models for capturing wind distributions at pedestrian height. These findings demonstrate that complex pedestrian wind patterns can be effectively predicted using an image-based ML approach, circumventing the need to resolve complex physical equations directly.\\n   \n",

However, the continent faces challenges with groundwater scarcity due to factors like population growth, climate change, and over exploitation. Over the past ten years, machine learning has been increasingly and successfully used in groundwater level prediction across the world. This review paper explores the application of machine learning techniques in predicting groundwater levels in Africa. The methodology involved downloading relevant papers, identifying and categorizing the machine learning algorithms employed, and quantifying their use. Geological and climatic variables were also identified, analyzed and categorized to measure their usage frequency. The different algorithms and input variables extracted from each paper are graphically represented in this document highlighting the most employed ones. The findings suggest that the available literature on this topic in Africa is limited compared to the rest of the world. Tree-based algorithms are commonly used in machine learning in Africa, and the most employed input variables are related to geomorphology and temperature.

But Global climate models run at coarse spatial resolution which is difficult to do regional analysis. Regional-scale projections can be obtained by a technique called statistical downscaling which uses past data to find out the high resolution and low-resolution mapping. There are many methods for statistical downscaling of climate data: 1) Conventional methods 2) Deep learning architecture. Some of the existing works like DeepSd downscaled High-resolution climate projections but in such cases, Global climate model (GCM) data suffers from concept drift, change of mapping between input and label over time. So applying these deep learning models is not a good idea for statistical downscaling. In our study, we have developed new approach of downscaling which outperforms other deep learning architectures like super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN), Long short term memory network (LSTM) in terms of accuracy and reliability. These existing models focus on minimizing the root mean square error (RMSE ) and do not take care of the tails or extremes. Therefore the objective function of these models should be changed other than root mean square error (RMSE). Our proposed model focuses on both means and extremes.

As a first application in glaciology, a scenario-neutral approach, using climatic mass balance as a system response, is applied to four glaciers: Hintereisferner (AT), Peyto Glacier (CA), Austre Br√∏ggerbreen (NO) and Abramov Glacier (KGZ). The Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM) is used to perform a scenario-neutral glacier sensitivity analysis, resulting in visual, two-dimensional response surfaces, and a glacier sensitivity index (GSI). In addition, four Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models (CMIP6) (FGOALS3, MPI-ESM1, EG-Earth 3, NorESM2), under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) (1-2.6, 2-4.5, 3-7.0, 5-8.5) are overlaid, for comparison. Assessing results shows that overall, Hintereisferner is most sensitive to changes in climate overall, and temperature especially, with a temperature GSI of 1.12 m w.e./¬∞C - 1.96 m w.e./¬∞C, versus, for example, a temperature GSI of 0.56 m w.e./¬∞C - 0.81 m w.e./¬∞C for Peyto glacier. Seasonally, we see differences in sensitivity between climatic variables and glaciers, too. Overlaying time slices of the CMIP6 models emphasizes how scenario-neutral approaches are suitable for use in glacier modelling, especially as a framework for sensitivity studies.\\n   \n",

Glacier area is an essential climate variable but its tracking is complicated by the labour-intensive manual digitisation of satellite imagery. Here we introduce ICEmapper, a deep learning model that maps glacier outlines from Sentinel-1 time series with accuracy on par with human experts. We used this model to retrieve Svalbard glacier outlines for 2016‚Äì2024 and found a tripling of the glacier area loss rate (-260 km2 p.a.) in the last decade as compared to that previously reported for 1980‚Äì2010 (-80 km2 p.a.). This acceleration is largely driven by increased calving at tidewater glaciers and the climatic warming signal impacting land-terminating glaciers. Additionally, our analysis shows significant area changes related to glacier surging, namely, the Nathorstbreen system and Austfonna, Basin-3 surges. These two surges collectively added to the area change in 2006‚Äì2016 (+194.30 km2 or +0.59%), thus delaying the regionwide area loss by approximately two years. Our results indicate a significant acceleration in glacier area loss in Svalbard, and we anticipate broader applications of our method to track glacier changes on larger scales.\\n   \n",

In recent years, HAB events have become a serious environmental problem, paralleling population growth, agricultural development, increasing air temperatures, and declining precipitation. Hence, it is crucial to identify the mechanisms responsible for the formation of harmful algal blooms (HABs), accurately assess their short- and long-term impacts, and quantify their variations based on climate projections for developing accurate action plans and effectively managing resources. This present study utilizes empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) to predict chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration of Lake Erie. This method is characterized by its nonlinearity and nonparametric nature. EDM has a significant benefit in that it surpasses the constraints of conventional statistical modeling through the use of data-driven attractor reconstruction. Chl-a is a critical and commonly used parameter in the prediction of HAB events. Lake Erie is an inland water body that experiences frequent HAB phenomena as a result of its location. With a MAPE of 4.31%, an RMSE of 6.24, and a coefficient of determination of 0.98, the EDM showed exceptional performance. These findings suggest that the underlying dynamics of chl-a changes can be well captured by the EDM model.\\n   \n",

Internal climate variability combines with the forced global warming response to determine both the magnitude and spatial distribution of these events, and their consequences can propagate from one country to another via many pathways. We examine how exposure to compound climate hazards in one country is transmitted internationally via agricultural trade networks by analyzing a large ensemble of climate model simulations and comprehensive trade data of four crops (i.e. wheat, maize, rice and soya). Combinations of variability-driven climate patterns and existing global agricultural trade give rise to a wide range of possible outcomes in the current climate. In the most extreme simulated year, 20% or more of the caloric supply in nearly one third of the world’s countries are exposed to compound heat and precipitation hazards. Countries with low levels of diversification, both in the number of suppliers and the regional climates of those suppliers, are more likely to import higher fractions of calories (up to 93%) that are exposed to these compound hazards. Understanding how calories exposed to climate hazards are transmitted through agricultural trade networks in the current climate can contribute to improved anticipatory capacity for national governments, international trade policy, and agricultural-sector resilience. We recommend concerted effort be made toward merging cutting-edge seasonal-to-decadal climate prediction with international trade analysis in support of a new era of anticipatory Anthropocene risk management.\\n   \n",

The arid climate, sparse vegetation and low topographic relief result in very high interferometric coherence magnitude between most pairs of dates, even for those separated by multiple years. For pairs of dates with differing soil moisture conditions, such as a “dry” date and a date immediately following one of the precipitation events, the interferometric coherence magnitude is much lower.  However, pairs spanning the same event, but with a longer time interval, have high interferometric coherence magnitude.  This observation suggests that the phase changes that result in lower coherence for some pairs are not permanent, such as those that would result from erosion or deposition of material, but are due to the variations in soil moisture.   In support of this view, when we compare the phase of individual pixels to their neighbors, we observe similar phase change trends for each precipitation event. We present a simple statistical model of the relationship between soil moisture and phase, and show that it predicts the observed coherence and phase histories within this particular SAR time series.  We also show how the parameters of this relationship can be inferred from the InSAR observables, and can be used to reduce the soil moisture effects on coherence and phase even for pairs of dates that were not used in that parameter estimation.  For the test data considered here, the noise associated with soil moisture is lowered by 40%. We present results for synthetic time series, including a demonstration of the widely-observed phenomenon that displacement rates inferred from InSAR time series depend on the choice of interferometric pairs used in the analysis.\\n   \n",

This stratification is a key attribute of the region as it acts as an effective barrier for the vertical exchanges of Atlantic Water heat, nutrients, and CO2 between intermediate depths and the surface of the Eurasian and Amerasian basins (EB and AB). Observations show that from 1970 to 2017, the stratification in the AB has strengthened, whereas, in parts of the EB, the stratification has weakened. The strengthening in the AB is linked to freshening and deepening of the halocline. In the EB, the weakened stratification is associated with salinification and shoaling of the halocline (Atlantification). Simulations from a suite of CMIP6 models project that, under a strong greenhouse-gas forcing scenario (ssp585), the overall surface freshening and warming continue in both basins, but there is a divergence in hydrographic trends in certain regions. Within the AB, there is agreement among the models that the upper layers will become more stratified. However, within the EB, models diverge regarding future stratification. This is due to different balances between trends at the surface and trends at depth, related to Fram Strait fluxes. The divergence affects projections of future state of Arctic sea ice, as models with the strongest Atlantification project the strongest decline in sea ice volume in the EB. From these simulations, one could conclude that Atlantificaton will not spread eastward into the AB; however, we need to improve models to simulate tendencies in a more delicately stratified EB correctly.\\n   \n",

However, extensive amount of energy is required to produce one kilogram of tea, making tea processing energy-intensive. Comparing greenhouse gas emissions from different types of energy consumed in tea factories is imperative to enable policymakers make informed intervention in emission reduction. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in tea factories is one of the pathways to meeting Kenya’s nationally determined 32% reduction of carbon emissions by 2030 and commitment to the Paris Agreement. This paper assesses greenhouse gas emissions from different sources of energy used in four tea factories in Kenya. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission factor is used to calculate the total emissions of each type of energy used for 5 years. Life cycle assessment using simapro software is used to assess the specific compound causing the emission. The findings reveal that the 5-year greenhouse gas emissions by biogas, solar, wood, briquettes, and electricity are 336,111, 7,108, 20,201.06, and 1,338.28 kg CO2/kWh, respectively. Firewood has the highest concentration of carbon dioxide, while solar energy has the least. Analysis of variance confirms significant difference (0.05>p=0.0272) in greenhouse gas emissions from the different energy sources. Post-hoc analyses shows a significant difference in emissions between solar and firewood (p<0.0125) and no significant difference between other sources of energy. Sustainability in the tea sector can be achieved through switching to macadamia briquettes as a source of thermal energy and a combination of electricity and solar for electrical energy.\\n   \n",

The growing demand for critical minerals such as lithium and associated water demands in these arid environments has amplified the urgency to address these uncertainties. We present an integrated hydrological analysis of the Dry Andes region utilizing a uniquely comprehensive set of tracer data (3H, 18O/2H) for this type of environment, paired directly with physical hydrological observations. We find two strongly decoupled hydrological systems that interact only under specific hydrogeological conditions where preferential conduits have developed. The primary conditions in these conduits form are when laterally extensive fine-grained evaporite and/or lacustrine units or perennial flowing streams exist in connection with groundwater discharge sites. These conduits which efficiently capture and transport modern or “contemporary” water (weeks to years old) within the system control the interplay between modern hydroclimate variations and groundwater aquifers. Modern waters account for a small portion of basin budgets but are critical to sustaining surface waters due to the existence of these conduits. As a result, surface waters near basin floors are disproportionally sensitive to short-term climate and anthropogenic perturbations. This framework describes a new understanding of the dominant controls on natural water cycles intrinsic to these arid high-elevation systems which improves our ability to manage critical water resources.\\n   \n",

Existing models often assume the availability of comprehensive datasets, an assumption that does not hold true for LICs. This paper introduces a set of innovative frameworks designed to overcome data scarcity by integrating sparse agricultural data, high-resolution climate information, and advanced machine learning techniques. At the core of this approach is a Bayesian hierarchical model that combines satellite-derived climate data with incomplete in-situ agricultural data, enabling probabilistic estimates of productivity in data-limited contexts. The paper also presents a dynamic panel data model to explore long-term interactions between climate and agriculture, capturing sectoral dynamics over extended periods. Additionally, a novel framework for real-time assessment of agricultural productivity loss is introduced, leveraging Bayesian inference to estimate losses based on environmental proxies. These models are intended to improve predictive accuracy and provide practical tools for real-time monitoring and long-term analysis in data-constrained settings, contributing to stronger climate resilience and more informed decision-making in LICs.\\n   \n",

Indeed, according to the National Weather Service, the number of severe storms has increased in the United States from 1 – 3/decade in the 1950s through the 1980s, to 8/decade in the 1990s, 30/decade in the 2000s, and 54/decade in the 2010s. Here we argue that a Severe Storm Index (SSI), calculated by dividing the sum of storms/decade by 10, is readily intelligible and can be used as a gauge to inform our behavior as we seek to correct climate change in the United States via a large-scale, fully integrated, “war-time like” effort.\\n   \n",

While submesoscale dynamics are known to impact biological fluxes by modifying nutrient upwelling, horizontal transport has traditionally been assumed to only redistribute phytoplankton without altering concentrations. However, variations in submesoscale dispersion may significantly impact total biogeochemical flux if biological reactions occur during dispersal. By parameterizing the effects of dispersion due to lateral stirring on flux, within an eastern boundary current region, we show that enhanced dispersion yields a near-linear increase in offshore flux, with the magnitude modulated by phytoplankton growth rates and ambient nutrient availability. These findings identify a pathway for improving parameterizations of biogeochemical fluxes, while revealing a source of uncertainty in their prediction by climate models.\\n   \n",

In addition to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, one of the primary proposals for counteracting this increase in wildfire danger is a widespread expansion of hazardous fuel reductions. Here, we quantify the potential for fuel reduction to reduce wildfire intensity using empirical relationships derived from historical observations using a novel combination of spatiotemporal resolution (0.5km, hourly) and extent (48 million acres, 9 years). We use machine learning to quantify relationships between sixteen environmental conditions (including ten fuel characteristics and four temperature-affected aridity characteristics) and satellite-observed fire radiative power. We use the derived relationships to create fire intensity potential (FIP) maps of sixty historical weather snapshots at a 2km and hourly resolution. We then place these weather snapshots in differing background climatological temperature and fuel characteristic conditions to quantify their independent and combined influence on FIP. We find that in order to offset the effect of climate warming under the SSP2-4.5 emissions scenario, fuel reduction would need to be maintained perpetually on ~3 million acres (at a 5-year return frequency, 600,000 acres, or ~1% of our domain, per year) by 2050 and ~8 million acres (at a 5-year return frequency, 1.6 million acres, or ~3% of our domain, per year) by 2090. Overall, we find substantial potential for fuel reduction to negate the effects of climate warming and that whether or not fuel reduction is scaled up has larger leverage on our domain average FIP than shifting global greenhouse gas emissions from the SSP2-4.5 to the SSP1-2.6 trajectory.\\n   \n",

The analysis involves detrending weather data by calculating first differences and then computing the cross-correlation function, or CCF with wind power capacity. The calculations are benchmarked using atmospheric CO2 concentration. The consistency of a significant correlation is tested by detrending using linear residuals and then calculating the CCF on the basis of the residuals, corrected for autocorrelation using the Cochrane-Orcutt procedure [4]. In four cases, where the data were reliable, the analysis provided a clear distinction in favour of wind power as a putative cause of the weather trends, in preference to atmospheric CO2 concentration. Where the quality of the data was less reliable, the outcome was inconclusive. Nevertheless, it would seem that our efforts to mitigate anthropogenic global warning with wind power might well be having a deleterious effect on weather patterns\\n   \n",

These Avicennia-only mangroves have been considered impoverished mangroves controlled by the general latitudinal temperature gradient. The MCO Mediterranean mangroves have been compared with the extant Middle East (ME) mangroves around the Arabian Peninsula, characterized by the dominance of Avicennia and their low diversity. However, these extant communities are not a latitudinal feature but rather an anomaly shaped by extreme environmental conditions (aridity, hypersalinity, sediment supply) that only a few mangrove species can tolerate. In contrast, reconstructed environments for MCO Mediterranean mangroves indicate mild, rainy climates. We conclude that current ME mangroves cannot be considered modern analogs for the MCO Mediterranean mangroves. Finding such modern analogs is challenging, and further studies are recommended to uncover their ecological and biogeographical patterns.\\n   \n",

Existing emission scenarios that fail to reflect this transition increasingly diverge from reality. To bridge this gap, we developed an interdisciplinary and multi-model framework that integrates up-to-date emissions inventory and emissions pathway to net zero CO2 by 2060 for China, and then constructed a reality-aligned, sector-specific combined scenario (SSP2-com) for greenhouse gases and air pollutants across global-to-regional, national-to-provincial, and multi-resolution-grid scales. Our emissions pathway sees that global CO₂ will peak in concentration by 2062, and achieve net zero in emissions by 2072. The Asia-Pacific region, particularly China, will lead these reductions through contributions from the energy and industrial sectors. Climate emulators show global temperatures will initially follow SSP2-4.5 but later become more compatible with SSP1-2.6 trends, projected to peak around 2071 and reach a rise of 2.01°C by 2100 (~3.2 W m-2) or for the period 2091-2110, with temperatures falling below 2°C in the first decade after 2100, relevant to the Paris Agreement target. We further propose an evolving SSP2-com+ framework, integrating updated regional and national emission trajectories, to align with commitments more timely and enhance global cooperation. Our findings indicate that balanced, nationally-determined decarbonization efforts can stabilize warming around 2°C without requiring early unprecedented decarbonization rates or large-scale carbon removal efforts. These strategies align more closely with current emission status and national commitments than other existing scenarios, providing a more plausible basis for earth system models.\\n   \n",

A growing number of field studies have linked the change in fire regime to post-fire recruitment failure and permanent forest loss. In this study we used four burnt area and two forest loss datasets to calculate the landscape-scale fire return interval (FRI) and associated risk of permanent forest loss. We then used machine learning to predict how the FRI will change under a high emissions scenario (SSP3-7.0) by the end of the century. We found that there is currently 133 000 km2 at high, or extreme, risk of fire-induced forest loss, with a further 3 M km2 at risk by the end of the century. This has the potential to degrade or destroy some of the largest remaining intact forests in the world, negatively impact the health and economic wellbeing of people living in the region, as well as accelerate global climate change.\\n   \n",

Based on the most widely used Köppen-Geiger scheme, this article proposes a neural network based climate classification method from a data science perspective. In conventional schemes, empirically handcrafted rules are used to divide climate data into climate types, resulting in certain defects. In the proposed method, a machine learning mechanism is employed to do the task. Specifically, the method first trains a convolutional neural network to fit climate data to land cover conditions, then extracts features from the trained network and finally uses a self-organizing map to cluster land pixels on the extracted features. The method is applied to cluster global land represented by 66,501 pixels (each covers 0.5 latitude degree × 0.5 longitude degree) using 2020 land cover data and 1991-2020 climate normals, and a 4 × 3 × 2 hexagonal self-organizing map clusters the land pixels into twenty-four climate types. By Kappa statistics, the obtained scheme shows good agreement with the Köppen-Geiger and Köppen-Trewartha schemes. In addition, our scheme addresses some issues of the Köppen schemes, suggests new climate types such as As (severe dry-wet season) and Fw (arctic desert), and identifies the highland group H without input of elevation. The proposed method is expected as an intelligent tool to monitor changes in the global climate pattern and to discover new climate types of interest that possibly emerge in the future. It may also be valuable for bio-ecology communities.\\n</td>\n",

Fire management agencies require information about near-real time wildfire vulnerability in boreal peatlands. Remote sensing tools (e.g., NDVI, NDII) to monitor changing wildfire vulnerability focus on monitoring changes in vascular vegetation and are not necessarily applicable to moss-dominated peatlands. We use time series analysis of Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data to compare the trends in peatlands that have burned to unburned peatlands and show that the Theil-Sen slopes of seasonally decomposed SAR backscatter reflects prolonged drought conditions that can lead to burning. Seasonally decomposed Sentinel-2 NDVI and NDII were also tested but no statistical differences were found between burned and unburned peatlands. Overall, we found that 6 months prior to a wildfire the slope of seasonally decomposed Sentinel-1 VV SAR backscatter was significantly different in burned and unburned peatlands, and can be used to spatially identify fire vulnerability and identify fire-prone areas.\\n</td>\n",

Although the basic science showing that CO2 would absorb the infrared radiation emitted by the earth produce a surface-warming effect was first calculated by Arrhenius in 1896, the issue was neglected by the scientific community for decades. Today there are ample climate models of the climactic effects arising from the forcing term of increasing P[CO2]. In this paper we follow Arrhenius’ concept, although we use the HITRAN database as the input to prove the connection between earth’s surface temperature and atmospheric absorption of terrestrial radiation in a direct manner that the reader can also implement. The spectra of CO2 are enormously complicated, broadened by Fermi Resonance, and intense because of the quantum coupling of the rotation of CO2 to its bending. Using an on-line database for the transitions of CO2 the reader will easily be able to show that CO2 reduces the transmittance of the Earth’s thermal radiation through the atmosphere, which in turn results in heating of the surface. The model does not make any predictions other than that the global temperature will increase as a function of P[CO2].

These microbes reduce surface albedo, which, in turn, could lead to warming and enhanced glacier melt. Here we present results from a replicated, controlled field experiment to quantify the impact of microbes on snowmelt in red-snow communities. Addition of nitrogen‚Äìphosphorous‚Äìpotassium fertilizer increased alga cell counts nearly fourfold, to levels similar to nitrogen‚Äìphosphorus-enriched lakes; water alone increased counts by half. The manipulated alga abundance explained a third of the observed variability in snowmelt. Using a normalized-difference spectral index we estimated alga abundance from satellite imagery and calculated microbial contribution to snowmelt on an icefield of 1,900 km2. The red-snow area extended over about 700 km2, and in this area we determined that microbial communities were responsible for 17% of the total snowmelt there. Our results support hypotheses that snow-dwelling microbes increase glacier melt directly in a bio-geophysical feedback by lowering albedo and indirectly by exposing low-albedo glacier ice. Radiative forcing due to perennial populations of microbes may match that of non-living particulates at high latitudes. Their contribution to climate warming is likely to grow with increased melt and nutrient input.\\n</td>\n",

Although previous studies have shown that regional warming escalates wildfire in the western USA, such an unprecedented fire cannot be explained by climate variability alone. Here we show that the synoptic-scale feedback between the wildfires and weather played an unexpectedly important role in accelerating the spread of this fire and also trapped pollutants in the shallow boundary layer over valley cities. Specifically, we find that aerosol-radiation interaction of the smoke plumes over the Cascade Mountains enhanced the downslope winds and weakened the moisture transport, thereby forming a positive feedback loop that amplified the fires and contributed to ~54% of estimated air-pollution related deaths.

However, none of the current commensuration approaches are suitable for addressing the current climatic effect of mire ecosystems as compared to the situation in which such mires would not exist. The mire ecosystems have accumulated carbon for millennia, creating a negative perturbation to the atmospheric carbon dioxide content, but at the same time they emit methane into the atmosphere. Thus, the functioning of mires involves GHG fluxes with opposing effects on Earth’s radiative balance. Here, based on a simple radiative forcing (RF) model, we propose a new metric for commensuration of the effects of accumulated carbon and methane emission (ACME) on Earth’s energy balance. This ACME approach is applicable to natural mires with a significant part of their carbon accumulated more than 1000 years ago and requires relatively few input data. We demonstrate the feasibility of the ACME approach by applying it to a set of northern mires. The ACME-based RF estimate indicates that these mires have a cooling effect on the current climate, contrary to what a global warming potential-based calculation suggests, since the climatic effect is dominated by the sustained carbon accumulation. By applying the new metric with varying estimates of the total carbon storage and methane emission of northern mires, we estimate the current RF of these mires to range from –0.45 to –0.23 W m-2.\\n</td>\n",

In this study, we make the first compilation of a quasi-climatologic dataset covering 6 years (2015–2020) of hourly near-surface air temperature measurements obtained via 1560 suitable CWS in a domain covering south-east England and Greater London. We investigated the spatio- temporal distribution of urban heat and the influences of local environments on climate, captured by CWS through the scope of Local Climate Zones (LCZ) – a land-use land-cover classification specifically designed for urban climate studies. We further calculate, for the first time, the amount of advected heat captured by CWS located in Greater London and the wider south east England region. We find that London is on average warmer by ∼1.0 ◦C to ∼2.0 ◦C than the rest of south-east England. Characteristics of the southern coastal climate are also captured in the analysis. We find that on average, urban heat advection (UHA) contributes to 0.22 ◦C of the total urban heat in Greater London. Certain areas, mostly in the centre of London are deprived of urban heat through advection since heat is transferred more to downwind suburban areas. UHA can positively contribute to urban heat by up to ∼2.0 ◦C on average and negatively by down to ∼-1.0 ◦C. Our results also show an important degree of inter- and intra-LCZ variability in UHA, calling for more research in the future. Nevertheless, we already find that UHA can impact green areas and reduce their cooling benefit. Such outcomes show the added value of CWS for future urban design.\\n</td>\n",

Indigenous communities, with their long history of coastal resource utilization, are especially vulnerable. This study investigates the social, economic, and environmental impacts of coastal erosion and flooding in Channel-Port aux Basques, Newfoundland. Hurricane Fiona’s devastating impact on the community in 2022 underscores the urgency of adaptation strategies. The research employed a multi-pronged approach: data analysis from weather and census sources, a literature review, a vulnerability assessment using established frameworks, and agent-based modeling using NetLogo software. Findings reveal significant social impacts, including displacement, emotional distress, and loss of public spaces. While existing adaptation measures like shoreline armoring offer some protection, their effectiveness in the face of stronger storms and projected sea level rise remains questionable. The agent-based model predicts increased coastal erosion, with households within 8 meters experiencing erosion within the first year at current sea level rise rates. The study recommends developing a comprehensive plan to mitigate coastal erosion risks. Potential solutions include sea walls and promoting sustainable land-use practices that prioritize coastal ecosystems and managed retreat strategies.

              "      <td>The importance of subtropical and extratropical zonal wind stress on Pacific Subtropical Cells (STCs) strength is assessed through several idealized numerical experiments performed with a global ocean model. Different zonal wind stress anomalies are employed, and their intensity is strengthened or weakened with respect to the climatological value throughout a suite of simulations.   Strengthened (weakened) zonal wind stress anomalies result in increased (decreased) STCs meridional mass and energy transport. Upwelling of subsurface water into the tropics is intensified (reduced), a distinct cold (warm) anomaly appears in the equatorial thermocline and up to the surface, resulting in significant tropical sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies.   Results hold for both subtropical and extratropical anomalies, suggesting the potential impact of mid-latitude atmospheric modes of variability on tropical climate.  Finally, the remotely-driven response is compared with a set of locally-forced simulations, where an equatorial zonal wind stress anomaly is imposed. A dynamically distinct response is achieved, whereby the equatorial thermocline adjusts to the wind stress anomaly resulting in significant equatorial SST anomalies as in the remotely-forced simulations. Significant anomalies in the Indonesian throughflow are generated only when equatorial wind stress anomalies are applied, leading to remarkable heat content anomalies in the Indian Ocean.  Equatorial wind stress anomalies experiments do not involve modifications of STC transports, but could set up the appropriate initial conditions for a tropical-extratropical teleconnection, involving both Hadley cells and STC anomalous transports.\\n</td>\n",

This article posits that selective science communication and unrealistically optimistic assumptions are obscuring the reality that greenhouse gas emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal will not curtail climate change in the 21st Century. It also explains how overly pessimistic and speculative criticisms are behind opposition to considering potential climate cooling interventions as a complementary approach for mitigating dangerous warming.  There is little evidence supporting assertions that: current greenhouse gas emissions reduction and removal methods can and will be ramped up in time to prevent dangerous climate change; overshoot of Paris Agreement targets will be temporary; net zero emissions will produce a safe, stable climate; the impacts of overshoot can be managed and reversed; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change models and assessments capture the full scope of prospective disastrous impacts; and the risks of climate interventions are greater than the risks of inaction.  These largely unsupported presumptions distort risk assessments and discount the urgent need to develop a viable mitigation strategy. Due to political pressures, many critical scientific concerns are ignored or preemptively dismissed in international negotiations. As a result, the present and growing crisis and the level of effort and time that will be required to control and rebalance the climate are severely underestimated.  In conclusion, the paper outlines the key elements of a realistic policy approach that would augment current efforts to constrain dangerous warming by supplementing current mitigation approaches with climate cooling interventions.\\n</td>\n",

Despite gaining popularity, studies of various stochastic subgrid scale parameterizations applied to atmospheric climate and weather prediction systems have revealed a diversity of model responses, including degeneracy in the response to different forcings and compensating model errors, with little reduction in artificial damping of the small scales required for numerical stability. Due to the greater range of spatio-temporal scales involved, how to best sample subgrid fluctuations in a computationally inexpensive manner, with the aim of reduced model error and improvements to the simulated climatological state of the ocean, remains an open question. While previous studies have considered perturbations to the surface forcing or subsurface temperature tendencies, we implement an energetically consistent, simple, stochastic subgrid eddy parameterization of the momentum fluxes in regions of the three-dimensional ocean typically associated with high eddy variability.  We consider the changes in the modelled energetics of low-resolution simulations in response to stochastically forced velocity tendencies whose perturbation statistics and amplitudes are calculated from an eddy resolving ocean configuration. Kinetic energy spectra from a triple-decomposition reveal a systematic redistribution from the seasonal (climatological minus mean) potential energy to preferentially generate small scale transient kinetic energy while the total energy spectra remains largely unchanged. We show that stochastic parameterization generally improves model biases, noticeably so for the simulated energetics of the Southern Oceans.\\n</td>\n",

We analyze one authoritative Pleistocene data set to explore how the climate sensitivity parameter S varies under different system states, using linear regression of mean annual surface temperature changes against CO2 forcing changes.  On the whole data set, S = 2.04K/Wm^(-2) and CO2 forcing explains 64% of the variance in temperature.  Partitioning the data by path (glaciation / de-glaciation); during de-glaciation episodes, S = 2.34K/Wm^(-2), explaining 75% of the temperature variance; during glaciations, S = 1.59K/Wm^(-2) explaining 48% of the temperature variance. Further partitioning into epochs before and after the Marine Isotope Stage 11 424 kaBP (thousand years before present); for de-glaciation paths after 424 kaBP, S = 2.63 K/Wm^(-2) explaining 83% of the variance.  Partitioning into levels of CO2 concentration has much less explanatory power; 20% for concentrations above 210 ppmv and 2% for concentrations below 210 ppmv. These partitions conflate glaciation and de-glaciation episodes and pre/post 424 kaBP epochs.  Possible process-related explanations for the path-related differences are conjectured.  The common assumption that changes in temperature are proportional to changes in CO2 forcing constrains the regression intercept to pass through the origin and inflates the regression error to the extent that the regression model becomes a worse predictor of temperature changes than simply predicting the population mean for all values of CO2 forcing. The consequences of this assumption are substantive in the context of estimating future temperature trajectories and should be carefully weighed.\\n</td>\n",

Over the last two decades, we have improved our understanding of how mass distribution on the Earth‚Äôs surface, in particular changes in ice and water distribution linked to glacial cycles, affects mantle melting, crustal magmatic processing and eruption rates. New hypotheses on the impacts of climate change on eruption processes have also emerged, including how eruption style and volcanic plume rise are affected by changing surface and atmospheric conditions, and how volcanic sulfate aerosol lifecycle, radiative forcing and climate impacts are modulated by background climate conditions. Future improvements in past climate reconstructions and current climate observations, volcanic eruption records and volcano monitoring, and numerical models will contribute to boost research on climate-volcano impacts.

Since in the last few decades in many regions, nutrients in lakes were reduced simultaneously as the climate changed. Yet, it remains unclear which of the two has impacted primary production the most. In this study, we couple the General Ocean Turbulence Model with the Ecological Regional Ocean Model to disentangle the effects of climate change and reoligotrophication on primary production (PP) in Lake Geneva, Switzerland-France. We apply a data assimilation method to calibrate the model with the observations from the past (1981-1990) and validate it against the in-situ data from the present decade (2011-2019). Both decades represent different climate conditions and trophic states of the lake. We show that the model is skilful to reproduce assimilated and unassimilated observations from both periods. According to our results, the effect of reoligotrophication on PP is marginally higher than that of warming, leading to a net decrease in primary production by 10% from the past to the present. The areal phosphorus supply in Lake Geneva, in spite of a decrease by 70%, is still characteristic of a meso-to-eutrophic ecosystem. This points towards an incomplete reoligotrophication of the lake. The effects of future climate change on winter mixing and PP dynamics have also been studied. Although there would be a significant reduction in deep mixing, the autotrophic production in Lake Geneva is expected to increase by 20% by the end of 21st century, largely due to stimulation in biomass build-up of temperature-dependent algae (e.g. dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria). Considering our results to represent other large temperate lakes with similar trophic status and water residence time as Lake Geneva, future climate scenarios are expected to bring back symptoms of eutrophication.\\n</td>\n",

In this study we explore its opportunities to project sub-national armed conflict risk for three shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) scenarios and three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) by 2040-2050 in Africa, using the novel and open-source ML framework CoPro. Results are consistent with the underlying socio-economic storylines of the SSPs, and the resulting out-of-sample armed conflict projections obtained with RandomForest classifiers agree with comparable studies. In SSP1-RCP2.6, conflict risk is low or absent in most regions, although the Horn of Africa and parts of Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique continue to be conflict-prone. Conflict risk intensifies in the more severe SSP3-RCP6.0 scenario, especially in central Africa and large parts of western Africa. We specifically assessed the role of hydro-climatic indicators as drivers of armed conflict. Overall, their importance is limited but can differ locally depending on the overall sign of climate change impact and the contextual (socio-economic) factors defining the overall magnitude of those impacts. With our study being at the forefront of ML applications for conflict risk projections, we have identified various challenges for this arising scientific field. A major concern is the inconsistent data availability of observed conflict events as well as of socio-economic indicators for the various SSPs. Nevertheless, ML models such as the one presented here are a viable way forward in the field of armed conflict risk projections, and can help to inform the policy-making process with respect to climate security.\\n</td>\n",

The computer model environment allows us to strictly control for variables such as sea surface temperature (SST), foraminifera species abundance response to SST, as well as depositional processes such as sediment accumulation rate (SAR) and bioturbation depth (BD), and subsequent laboratory processes such as sample size and machine error. Examining a number of best-case scenarios, we find that IFA-derived reconstructions of past SST variability are sensitive to all of the aforementioned variables. Running 100 ensembles for each scenario, we find that the influence of bioturbation upon IFA-derived SST reconstructions, combined with typical samples sizes employed in the field, produces noisy SST reconstructions with poor correlation to the original SST distribution in the water. This noise is especially apparent for values near the edge of the SST distribution, which is the distribution region of particular interest for, e.g., ENSO. The noise is further increased in the case of increasing machine error, decreasing SAR and decreasing sample size. We also find poor agreement between ensembles, underscoring the need for replication studies in the field to confirm findings at particular sites and time periods. Furthermore, we show that a species‚Äô abundance response to SST could in theory bias IFA-derived SST reconstructions, which can have consequences when comparing IFA-derived SST from markedly different mean climate states.

Several land-use change models exist that allocate coarse land-use changes at finer spatial scales, but there is no general, global, computationally tractable tool for downscaling to the spatial scale appropriate for understanding landscape and ecosystem change across different land-system scenarios. Here, we present a new model, the Spatial Economic Allocation Landscape Simulator (SEALS), which generates global, high resolution land-use, land-cover maps from coarse projections of land-use change. SEALS advances land-use change modeling research in several ways: it uses a novel machine-learning algorithm to empirically calibrate its parameters; it is a generalized approach that can be applied to very different types of projections within earth-economy models; and it is computationally efficient, generating global results at 300m resolution in approximately 1 hour on a laptop computer. We develop SEALS, and apply it to downscale 6 global scenarios of land-use change from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to 300m resolution, which we make publicly available, allowing researchers to project global, fine-scale changes in ecosystem services.

At the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD; northeastern Alberta, Canada), an internationally recognized remote freshwater landscape threatened by climate change and upstream industrial development (hydroelectric regulation of river flow, oil sands mining and processing), the need for an integrated aquatic ecosystem monitoring program has long been recognized to track changes to the flood regime, water balance, water quality, and contaminant deposition in the abundant shallow lakes.

Within this framework, we quantify uncertainties in the proxy system model parameters and in the interpretation of available proxy records. We find that despite these significant uncertainties, most paleoclimate models simulate a regional balance between precipitation and evaporative demand that could not have sustained the extent of recorded lakes from this time.

Global drivers for climatic change are particularly difficult to disentangle from regional ones, especially those caused by the complex tectonic evolution of the Tibetan region and its influence on the Asian monsoon system and vegetation. Here, we reconstruct the climatic and environmental history from the late Eocene into the early Oligocene at L√ºhe Basin, Yunnan, China, a key sedimentary repository along the SE margin of the Tibetan Plateau and an important region for assessing Asian monsoon changes. We investigate a 340-m long section via a multi-proxy approach and climate model simulations.

This temperature, cooler than the modern-day average for this site (ca. 15 ¬∞C), suggests that this area has not undergone significant uplift since the Oligocene. To further contextualize our data, we tested a suite of climate model simulations with varying pCO2, paleogeography, and Tibetan topography across the Eocene-Oligocene boundary.

Then, I examine changes in the mean, minimum, and maximum temperature and precipitation on an annual, monthly, and daily basis, respectively, under the high-emission SSP5-8.5 scenario. Furthermore, in the late century, annual maximum temperatures hit more than 40 °C in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and Vientiane. Cities in our study are projected to experience 5-6 °C increases in temperature from November to April, indicating significant changes in the seasonal cycle. Precipitation increases significantly from May to October in most large cities in our study, except for Johor Bahru, Malaysia, where some summer precipitation reductions are expected. Yangon, in particular, is projected to increase more than 4 millimeters per day in July, indicating a very high challenge from flooding as a city facing flood risk every year at present. In summary, our results indicate significant changes in the mean and extreme states of temperature and precipitations in Southeast Asia. Based on these, I identified major physical risks of climate change among the ten cities. Decision-makers should build resilience to these risks to avoid significant damage. Yukiko Hirabayashi et al. (2013) discovered that the risks of floods increase due to the degree of warming. Increasing floods might lead to damage to households and other organisms. Moreover, a greater incidence of climate change, such as droughts, in Southeast Asia is caused by decreasing precipitation in regions (Teerachai Amnuaylojaroen and Pavinee Chanvichit (2019)). This investigation particularly utilizes CMIP6 model simulations to predict the future pattern of climate extremes based on historical and present statistics. CMIP6 performs well in reproducing the climatological spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation, with better performance for temperature than precipitation to predict near future and future climate extremes is that it (Yang et al. for China). With large-ensemble data for climate extremes, CMIP6 can predict more precise climate extremes. This model is necessary for research about extreme climate, as it addresses the climate system's natural variability in different regions with different topographic features.\\n</td>\n",

As gender roles, culture, age, physical and physiological characteristics increase, mainly Nepalese women's and children's, health risks associated with climate change and air pollution, listening to and learning from women is critical. This study explores women's perspectives and lived experiences concerning climate change, consequent adverse impacts on agriculture and health, and ongoing adaptation and mitigation strategies. Assessing perspectives and lived experiences related to climate change can offer opportunities to explore understanding, local beliefs, experiences with adverse impacts and adaptation. We used a descriptive qualitative approach. An equal number of focus group discussions (FGDs, n=8) and key-informant interviews (KIIs, n=8) were conducted. Purposive and snowball sampling were used to recruit participants. Four research assistants with public health backgrounds and climate change training were employed to assist with this work. All interviews were conducted in the Nepali language using an interview guide. All KIIs and FGDs were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim in Nepali. Data were analyzed in NVivo 1.7 using content analysis. Forty-two of the 48 participants identified as women. The largest proportion of participants was aged greater than or equal to 50 years (18/48), had no formal education (21/48), and were either older women (&gt;55 years) (13/48) or mothers of children younger than five (11/48). Three main topical areas emerged from the FGDs and KIIs: (i) the winds of change, (ii) the unpredictability of weather, and (iii) acting locally. The study provides insights into how women and children in rural communities in a Nepali hill district experience, adapt and mitigate climate change impacts. These findings can help inform the development of interventions to better address women's and children's needs and concerns, essential to promoting well-being and reducing impacts exacerbated by climate change.\\n</td>\n",

However, lack of confidence in geologic CO2 storage security remains a barrier to CCS implementation. Here we present a numerical program that calculates CO2 storage security and leakage to the atmosphere over 10,000 years. This combines quantitative estimates of geological subsurface CO2 retention, and of surface CO2 leakage. We calculate that realistically well-regulated storage in regions with moderate well densities has a 50% probability that leakage remains below 0.0008% per year, with over 98% of the injected CO2 retained in the subsurface over 10,000 years. An unrealistic scenario, where CO2 storage is inadequately regulated, estimates that more than 78% will be retained over 10,000 years.

However, the impact of changes in precipitation amount and distribution on future glacier change remains uncertain because mesoscale meteorology is not represented in current models that project glacier change. We explored the combined effects of past and future changes in air temperature and precipitation amount and distribution on the evolution of Khumbu Glacier in the Everest region of Nepal—a benchmark glacier in the monsoon-influenced Nepal Himalaya—using a climate-glacier modelling approach that forces an ice-dynamical glacier evolution model with a surface mass balance forcing that includes mesoscale meteorological variables derived from downscaling of Regional Climate Model outputs. Our simulations show that historical warming during the late Holocene has committed Khumbu Glacier to future volume loss of 10–23% during this century. Under moderate future warming (RCP4.5) from the present day, Khumbu Glacier could lose 70% volume by 2100 CE due to increasing air temperatures. However, the projected increase in precipitation in tandem with climate warming could offset half of this loss, such that the total decrease in glacier volume by 2100 CE compared to the present day is only 34%. Extreme future warming (RCP8.5) will not be compensated by  changes in precipitation but will instead result in substantial ablation above 6,000 m, causing the highest glacier on Earth to vanish between 2160–2260 CE.\\n</td>\n",

The most common method for determining spatial wind speed patterns in cities relies on numerical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, which resolve Navier-Stokes equations around buildings. While effective, these simulations are computationally intensive and require specialised expertise, limiting their broader applicability. To address these limitations, this study proposes a more cost-effective alternative while maintaining the accuracy and spatial patterns captured by CFD. We developed a machine learning (ML) approach to predict wind speed patterns from prevailing wind directions and three- dimensional urban morphology, which are increasingly available for global cities. The model is trained and tested using a comprehensive dataset of 512 numerical simulations of urban neighbourhoods, representing diverse morphological configurations in cities worldwide. We find that the ML algorithm accurately predicts complex wind patterns, achieving a normalised mean absolute error of less than 10%, which is comparable to wind anemometer measurement in a low wind speed environment. In predicting wind statistics, the ML model also surpasses that of regression models based solely on statistical representations of urban morphology. The R2 values measuring grid-level agreement between ML and CFD range from 0.94-0.99 and 0.65-0.95, respectively, for the idealised and whole datasets. However, we find that grid-based R2 is not an effective metric for evaluating the 2D model performance due to localised biases arising from faster wind speed grid regions, which is revealed by the wind probability density function. This further confirms the suitability of the ML models for capturing wind distributions at pedestrian height. These findings demonstrate that complex pedestrian wind patterns can be effectively predicted using an image-based ML approach, circumventing the need to resolve complex physical equations directly.\\n</td>\n",

Regional-scale projections can be obtained by a technique called statistical downscaling which uses past data to find out the high resolution and low-resolution mapping. There are many methods for statistical downscaling of climate data: 1) Conventional methods 2) Deep learning architecture. Some of the existing works like DeepSd downscaled High-resolution climate projections but in such cases, Global climate model (GCM) data suffers from concept drift, change of mapping between input and label over time. So applying these deep learning models is not a good idea for statistical downscaling. In our study, we have developed new approach of downscaling which outperforms other deep learning architectures like super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN), Long short term memory network (LSTM) in terms of accuracy and reliability. These existing models focus on minimizing the root mean square error (RMSE ) and do not take care of the tails or extremes. Therefore the objective function of these models should be changed other than root mean square error (RMSE). Our proposed model focuses on both means and extremes. We provide a comparison between proposed and other existing deep learning models in downscaling daily precipitation and temperature from 1.25 to 0.25 resolution over India.

Assessing results shows that overall, Hintereisferner is most sensitive to changes in climate overall, and temperature especially, with a temperature GSI of 1.12 m w.e./¬∞C - 1.96 m w.e./¬∞C, versus, for example, a temperature GSI of 0.56 m w.e./¬∞C - 0.81 m w.e./¬∞C for Peyto glacier.

We used this model to retrieve Svalbard glacier outlines for 2016‚Äì2024 and found a tripling of the glacier area loss rate (-260 km2 p.a.) in the last decade as compared to that previously reported for 1980‚Äì2010 (-80 km2 p.a.). This acceleration is largely driven by increased calving at tidewater glaciers and the climatic warming signal impacting land-terminating glaciers.

These two surges collectively added to the area change in 2006‚Äì2016 (+194.30 km2 or +0.59%), thus delaying the regionwide area loss by approximately two years.

In recent years, HAB events have become a serious environmental problem, paralleling population growth, agricultural development, increasing air temperatures, and declining precipitation. Hence, it is crucial to identify the mechanisms responsible for the formation of harmful algal blooms (HABs), accurately assess their short- and long-term impacts, and quantify their variations based on climate projections for developing accurate action plans and effectively managing resources. This present study utilizes empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) to predict chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration of Lake Erie. This method is characterized by its nonlinearity and nonparametric nature. EDM has a significant benefit in that it surpasses the constraints of conventional statistical modeling through the use of data-driven attractor reconstruction. Chl-a is a critical and commonly used parameter in the prediction of HAB events. Lake Erie is an inland water body that experiences frequent HAB phenomena as a result of its location. With a MAPE of 4.31%, an RMSE of 6.24, and a coefficient of determination of 0.98, the EDM showed exceptional performance.

Internal climate variability combines with the forced global warming response to determine both the magnitude and spatial distribution of these events, and their consequences can propagate from one country to another via many pathways. We examine how exposure to compound climate hazards in one country is transmitted internationally via agricultural trade networks by analyzing a large ensemble of climate model simulations and comprehensive trade data of four crops (i.e. wheat, maize, rice and soya). Combinations of variability-driven climate patterns and existing global agricultural trade give rise to a wide range of possible outcomes in the current climate. In the most extreme simulated year, 20% or more of the caloric supply in nearly one third of the world’s countries are exposed to compound heat and precipitation hazards. Countries with low levels of diversification, both in the number of suppliers and the regional climates of those suppliers, are more likely to import higher fractions of calories (up to 93%) that are exposed to these compound hazards. Understanding how calories exposed to climate hazards are transmitted through agricultural trade networks in the current climate can contribute to improved anticipatory capacity for national governments, international trade policy, and agricultural-sector resilience.

The arid climate, sparse vegetation and low topographic relief result in very high interferometric coherence magnitude between most pairs of dates, even for those separated by multiple years. For pairs of dates with differing soil moisture conditions, such as a “dry” date and a date immediately following one of the precipitation events, the interferometric coherence magnitude is much lower.  However, pairs spanning the same event, but with a longer time interval, have high interferometric coherence magnitude.  This observation suggests that the phase changes that result in lower coherence for some pairs are not permanent, such as those that would result from erosion or deposition of material, but are due to the variations in soil moisture.   In support of this view, when we compare the phase of individual pixels to their neighbors, we observe similar phase change trends for each precipitation event. We present a simple statistical model of the relationship between soil moisture and phase, and show that it predicts the observed coherence and phase histories within this particular SAR time series.  We also show how the parameters of this relationship can be inferred from the InSAR observables, and can be used to reduce the soil moisture effects on coherence and phase even for pairs of dates that were not used in that parameter estimation.  For the test data considered here, the noise associated with soil moisture is lowered by 40%.

This stratification is a key attribute of the region as it acts as an effective barrier for the vertical exchanges of Atlantic Water heat, nutrients, and CO2 between intermediate depths and the surface of the Eurasian and Amerasian basins (EB and AB). Observations show that from 1970 to 2017, the stratification in the AB has strengthened, whereas, in parts of the EB, the stratification has weakened. The strengthening in the AB is linked to freshening and deepening of the halocline. In the EB, the weakened stratification is associated with salinification and shoaling of the halocline (Atlantification). Simulations from a suite of CMIP6 models project that, under a strong greenhouse-gas forcing scenario (ssp585), the overall surface freshening and warming continue in both basins, but there is a divergence in hydrographic trends in certain regions. Within the AB, there is agreement among the models that the upper layers will become more stratified. However, within the EB, models diverge regarding future stratification. This is due to different balances between trends at the surface and trends at depth, related to Fram Strait fluxes. The divergence affects projections of future state of Arctic sea ice, as models with the strongest Atlantification project the strongest decline in sea ice volume in the EB. From these simulations, one could conclude that Atlantificaton will not spread eastward into the AB; however, we need to improve models to simulate tendencies in a more delicately stratified EB correctly.\\n</td>\n",

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in tea factories is one of the pathways to meeting Kenya’s nationally determined 32% reduction of carbon emissions by 2030 and commitment to the Paris Agreement. This paper assesses greenhouse gas emissions from different sources of energy used in four tea factories in Kenya. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission factor is used to calculate the total emissions of each type of energy used for 5 years. Life cycle assessment using simapro software is used to assess the specific compound causing the emission. The findings reveal that the 5-year greenhouse gas emissions by biogas, solar, wood, briquettes, and electricity are 336,111, 7,108, 20,201.06, and 1,338.28 kg CO2/kWh, respectively. Firewood has the highest concentration of carbon dioxide, while solar energy has the least. Analysis of variance confirms significant difference (0.05&gt;p=0.0272) in greenhouse gas emissions from the different energy sources. Post-hoc analyses shows a significant difference in emissions between solar and firewood (p&lt;0.0125) and no significant difference between other sources of energy.

We present an integrated hydrological analysis of the Dry Andes region utilizing a uniquely comprehensive set of tracer data (3H, 18O/2H) for this type of environment, paired directly with physical hydrological observations. We find two strongly decoupled hydrological systems that interact only under specific hydrogeological conditions where preferential conduits have developed. The primary conditions in these conduits form are when laterally extensive fine-grained evaporite and/or lacustrine units or perennial flowing streams exist in connection with groundwater discharge sites. These conduits which efficiently capture and transport modern or “contemporary” water (weeks to years old) within the system control the interplay between modern hydroclimate variations and groundwater aquifers. Modern waters account for a small portion of basin budgets but are critical to sustaining surface waters due to the existence of these conduits. As a result, surface waters near basin floors are disproportionally sensitive to short-term climate and anthropogenic perturbations. This framework describes a new understanding of the dominant controls on natural water cycles intrinsic to these arid high-elevation systems which improves our ability to manage critical water resources.\\n</td>\n",

Existing models often assume the availability of comprehensive datasets, an assumption that does not hold true for LICs. This paper introduces a set of innovative frameworks designed to overcome data scarcity by integrating sparse agricultural data, high-resolution climate information, and advanced machine learning techniques. At the core of this approach is a Bayesian hierarchical model that combines satellite-derived climate data with incomplete in-situ agricultural data, enabling probabilistic estimates of productivity in data-limited contexts. The paper also presents a dynamic panel data model to explore long-term interactions between climate and agriculture, capturing sectoral dynamics over extended periods. Additionally, a novel framework for real-time assessment of agricultural productivity loss is introduced, leveraging Bayesian inference to estimate losses based on environmental proxies. These models are intended to improve predictive accuracy and provide practical tools for real-time monitoring and long-term analysis in data-constrained settings, contributing to stronger climate resilience and more informed decision-making in LICs.\\n</td>\n",

Indeed, according to the National Weather Service, the number of severe storms has increased in the United States from 1 – 3/decade in the 1950s through the 1980s, to 8/decade in the 1990s, 30/decade in the 2000s, and 54/decade in the 2010s. Here we argue that a Severe Storm Index (SSI), calculated by dividing the sum of storms/decade by 10, is readily intelligible and can be used as a gauge to inform our behavior as we seek to correct climate change in the United States via a large-scale, fully integrated, “war-time like” effort.\\n</td>\n",

While submesoscale dynamics are known to impact biological fluxes by modifying nutrient upwelling, horizontal transport has traditionally been assumed to only redistribute phytoplankton without altering concentrations. However, variations in submesoscale dispersion may significantly impact total biogeochemical flux if biological reactions occur during dispersal. By parameterizing the effects of dispersion due to lateral stirring on flux, within an eastern boundary current region, we show that enhanced dispersion yields a near-linear increase in offshore flux, with the magnitude modulated by phytoplankton growth rates and ambient nutrient availability. These findings identify a pathway for improving parameterizations of biogeochemical fluxes, while revealing a source of uncertainty in their prediction by climate models.\\n</td>\n",

In addition to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, one of the primary proposals for counteracting this increase in wildfire danger is a widespread expansion of hazardous fuel reductions. Here, we quantify the potential for fuel reduction to reduce wildfire intensity using empirical relationships derived from historical observations using a novel combination of spatiotemporal resolution (0.5km, hourly) and extent (48 million acres, 9 years). We use machine learning to quantify relationships between sixteen environmental conditions (including ten fuel characteristics and four temperature-affected aridity characteristics) and satellite-observed fire radiative power. We use the derived relationships to create fire intensity potential (FIP) maps of sixty historical weather snapshots at a 2km and hourly resolution. We then place these weather snapshots in differing background climatological temperature and fuel characteristic conditions to quantify their independent and combined influence on FIP. We find that in order to offset the effect of climate warming under the SSP2-4.5 emissions scenario, fuel reduction would need to be maintained perpetually on ~3 million acres (at a 5-year return frequency, 600,000 acres, or ~1% of our domain, per year) by 2050 and ~8 million acres (at a 5-year return frequency, 1.6 million acres, or ~3% of our domain, per year) by 2090. Overall, we find substantial potential for fuel reduction to negate the effects of climate warming and that whether or not fuel reduction is scaled up has larger leverage on our domain average FIP than shifting global greenhouse gas emissions from the SSP2-4.5 to the SSP1-2.6 trajectory.\\n</td>\n",

The analysis involves detrending weather data by calculating first differences and then computing the cross-correlation function, or CCF with wind power capacity. The calculations are benchmarked using atmospheric CO2 concentration. The consistency of a significant correlation is tested by detrending using linear residuals and then calculating the CCF on the basis of the residuals, corrected for autocorrelation using the Cochrane-Orcutt procedure [4]. In four cases, where the data were reliable, the analysis provided a clear distinction in favour of wind power as a putative cause of the weather trends, in preference to atmospheric CO2 concentration. Where the quality of the data was less reliable, the outcome was inconclusive. Nevertheless, it would seem that our efforts to mitigate anthropogenic global warning with wind power might well be having a deleterious effect on weather patterns\\n</td>\n",

These Avicennia-only mangroves have been considered impoverished mangroves controlled by the general latitudinal temperature gradient. The MCO Mediterranean mangroves have been compared with the extant Middle East (ME) mangroves around the Arabian Peninsula, characterized by the dominance of Avicennia and their low diversity. However, these extant communities are not a latitudinal feature but rather an anomaly shaped by extreme environmental conditions (aridity, hypersalinity, sediment supply) that only a few mangrove species can tolerate. In contrast, reconstructed environments for MCO Mediterranean mangroves indicate mild, rainy climates. We conclude that current ME mangroves cannot be considered modern analogs for the MCO Mediterranean mangroves.

Existing emission scenarios that fail to reflect this transition increasingly diverge from reality. To bridge this gap, we developed an interdisciplinary and multi-model framework that integrates up-to-date emissions inventory and emissions pathway to net zero CO2 by 2060 for China, and then constructed a reality-aligned, sector-specific combined scenario (SSP2-com) for greenhouse gases and air pollutants across global-to-regional, national-to-provincial, and multi-resolution-grid scales. Our emissions pathway sees that global CO₂ will peak in concentration by 2062, and achieve net zero in emissions by 2072. The Asia-Pacific region, particularly China, will lead these reductions through contributions from the energy and industrial sectors. Climate emulators show global temperatures will initially follow SSP2-4.5 but later become more compatible with SSP1-2.6 trends, projected to peak around 2071 and reach a rise of 2.01°C by 2100 (~3.2 W m-2) or for the period 2091-2110, with temperatures falling below 2°C in the first decade after 2100, relevant to the Paris Agreement target. We further propose an evolving SSP2-com+ framework, integrating updated regional and national emission trajectories, to align with commitments more timely and enhance global cooperation. Our findings indicate that balanced, nationally-determined decarbonization efforts can stabilize warming around 2°C without requiring early unprecedented decarbonization rates or large-scale carbon removal efforts. These strategies align more closely with current emission status and national commitments than other existing scenarios, providing a more plausible basis for earth system models.\\n</td>\n",

We then used machine learning to predict how the FRI will change under a high emissions scenario (SSP3-7.0) by the end of the century. We found that there is currently 133 000 km2 at high, or extreme, risk of fire-induced forest loss, with a further 3 M km2 at risk by the end of the century.

Accelerating research on this topic is critical in view of rapid climate change driven by anthropogenic activities. Over the last two decades, we have improved our understanding of how mass distribution on the Earth\\u201a\\u00c4\\u00f4s surface, in particular changes in ice and water distribution linked to glacial cycles, affects mantle melting, crustal magmatic processing and eruption rates. New hypotheses on the impacts of climate change on eruption processes have also emerged, including how eruption style and volcanic plume rise are affected by changing surface and atmospheric conditions, and how volcanic sulfate aerosol lifecycle, radiative forcing and climate impacts are modulated by background climate conditions. Future improvements in past climate reconstructions and current climate observations, volcanic eruption records and volcano monitoring, and numerical models will contribute to boost research on climate-volcano impacts. Important mechanisms remain to be explored, such as how changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation will affect the volcanic ash lifecycle. Fostering a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to climate-volcano impacts is critical to gain a full picture of how ongoing climate changes may affect the environmental and societal impacts of volcanic activity.\\n\",\n          \"Increasing fuel aridity due to climate warming has and will continue to increase wildfire danger in California. In addition to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, one of the primary proposals for counteracting this increase in wildfire danger is a widespread expansion of hazardous fuel reductions. Here, we quantify the potential for fuel reduction to reduce wildfire intensity using empirical relationships derived from historical observations using a novel combination of spatiotemporal resolution (0.5km, hourly) and extent (48 million acres, 9 years). We use machine learning to quantify relationships between sixteen environmental conditions (including ten fuel characteristics and four temperature-affected aridity characteristics) and satellite-observed fire radiative power. We use the derived relationships to create fire intensity potential (FIP) maps of sixty historical weather snapshots at a 2km and hourly resolution. We then place these weather snapshots in differing background climatological temperature and fuel characteristic conditions to quantify their independent and combined influence on FIP. We find that in order to offset the effect of climate warming under the SSP2-4.5 emissions scenario, fuel reduction would need to be maintained perpetually on ~3 million acres (at a 5-year return frequency, 600,000 acres, or ~1% of our domain, per year) by 2050 and ~8 million acres (at a 5-year return frequency, 1.6 million acres, or ~3% of our domain, per year) by 2090. Overall, we find substantial potential for fuel reduction to negate the effects of climate warming and that whether or not fuel reduction is scaled up has larger leverage on our domain average FIP than shifting global greenhouse gas emissions from the SSP2-4.5 to the SSP1-2.6 trajectory.\\n\",\n          \"Submesoscale dynamics, operating at spatial scales of O(1\\u201a\\u00e0\\u00ed10 km) and temporal scales of O(1 day), are particularly important for marine ecosystems as they occur on similar timescales as phytoplankton growth, enabling biophysical feedbacks. While submesoscale dynamics are known to impact biological fluxes by modifying nutrient upwelling, horizontal transport has traditionally been assumed to only redistribute phytoplankton without altering concentrations. However, variations in submesoscale dispersion may significantly impact total biogeochemical flux if biological reactions occur during dispersal. By parameterizing the effects of dispersion due to lateral stirring on flux, within an eastern boundary current region, we show that enhanced dispersion yields a near-linear increase in offshore flux, with the magnitude modulated by phytoplankton growth rates and ambient nutrient availability. These findings identify a pathway for improving parameterizations of biogeochemical fluxes, while revealing a source of uncertainty in their prediction by climate models.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Correct\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "0   Identifying and characterising dynamical regime shifts, critical transitions or potential  tipping points in palaeoclimate time series is relevant for improving the understanding of  often highly nonlinear Earth system dynamics. Beyond linear changes in time series  properties such as mean, variance, or trend, these nonlinear regime shifts can manifest  as changes in signal predictability, regularity, complexity, or higher-order stochastic  properties such as multi-stability. In recent years, several classes of methods have been put forward to study these critical  transitions in time series data that are based on concepts from nonlinear dynamics,  complex systems science, information theory, and stochastic analysis. These include approaches such as phase space-based recurrence plots  and recurrence networks, visibility graphs, order pattern-based entropies, and stochastic  modelling. Here, we review and compare in detail several prominent methods from these fields by applying them  to the same set of marine palaeoclimate proxy records of African climate variations during the past  5~million years.  Applying these methods, we observe notable nonlinear transitions in palaeoclimate dynamics  in these marine proxy records and discuss them in the context of important climate events  and regimes such as phases of intensified Walker circulation, marine isotope stage M2,  the onset of northern hemisphere glaciation and the mid-Pleistocene transition.  We find that the studied approaches complement each other by allowing us to point out distinct aspects of dynamical regime shifts in palaeoclimate time series. We also detect significant correlations of these nonlinear regime shift indicators with variations  of Earth's orbit, suggesting the latter as potential triggers of nonlinear transitions in palaeoclimate. Overall, the presented study underlines the potentials of nonlinear time series analysis approaches to provide complementary information on dynamical regime shifts in palaeoclimate and their driving processes that cannot be revealed by linear statistics or eyeball inspection of the data alone.\\n   \n",

Based on the most widely used Köppen-Geiger scheme, this article proposes a neural network based climate classification method from a data science perspective. In conventional schemes, empirically handcrafted rules are used to divide climate data into climate types, resulting in certain defects. In the proposed method, a machine learning mechanism is employed to do the task. Specifically, the method first trains a convolutional neural network to fit climate data to land cover conditions, then extracts features from the trained network and finally uses a self-organizing map to cluster land pixels on the extracted features. The method is applied to cluster global land represented by 66,501 pixels (each covers 0.5 latitude degree × 0.5 longitude degree) using 2020 land cover data and 1991-2020 climate normals, and a 4 × 3 × 2 hexagonal self-organizing map clusters the land pixels into twenty-four climate types. By Kappa statistics, the obtained scheme shows good agreement with the Köppen-Geiger and Köppen-Trewartha schemes. In addition, our scheme addresses some issues of the Köppen schemes, suggests new climate types such as As (severe dry-wet season) and Fw (arctic desert), and identifies the highland group H without input of elevation. The proposed method is expected as an intelligent tool to monitor changes in the global climate pattern and to discover new climate types of interest that possibly emerge in the future. It may also be valuable for bio-ecology communities.\\n   \n",

Correspondingly, changes in hydrologic regimes could lead to increased drought and occurrence of wildfire. Fire management agencies require information about near-real time wildfire vulnerability in boreal peatlands. Remote sensing tools (e.g., NDVI, NDII) to monitor changing wildfire vulnerability focus on monitoring changes in vascular vegetation and are not necessarily applicable to moss-dominated peatlands. We use time series analysis of Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data to compare the trends in peatlands that have burned to unburned peatlands and show that the Theil-Sen slopes of seasonally decomposed SAR backscatter reflects prolonged drought conditions that can lead to burning. Seasonally decomposed Sentinel-2 NDVI and NDII were also tested but no statistical differences were found between burned and unburned peatlands. Overall, we found that 6 months prior to a wildfire the slope of seasonally decomposed Sentinel-1 VV SAR backscatter was significantly different in burned and unburned peatlands, and can be used to spatially identify fire vulnerability and identify fire-prone areas.\\n   \n",

Passive microwave remote sensing allows estimating carbon from deep canopy layers through the Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) parameter. Although their spatial resolution is coarser than that of optical vegetation indices or airborne Lidar data, microwaves present a higher penetration capacity at low frequencies (Lband) and avoid cloud masking. This work compares the relationships of airborne carbon maps in Central and South America with both (i) SMAP L-band VOD at 9 km gridding and (ii) MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Models to estimate carbon stocks are built from these two satellite derived variables. Results show that L-band VOD has a greater capacity to model carbon variability than EVI. The resulting VOD-derived carbon estimates are further presented at a detailed (9 km) spatial scale.\\n   \n",

Although the basic science showing that CO2 would absorb the infrared radiation emitted by the earth produce a surface-warming effect was first calculated by Arrhenius in 1896, the issue was neglected by the scientific community for decades. Today there are ample climate models of the climactic effects arising from the forcing term of increasing P[CO2]. In this paper we follow Arrhenius’ concept, although we use the HITRAN database as the input to prove the connection between earth’s surface temperature and atmospheric absorption of terrestrial radiation in a direct manner that the reader can also implement. The spectra of CO2 are enormously complicated, broadened by Fermi Resonance, and intense because of the quantum coupling of the rotation of CO2 to its bending. Using an on-line database for the transitions of CO2 the reader will easily be able to show that CO2 reduces the transmittance of the Earth’s thermal radiation through the atmosphere, which in turn results in heating of the surface. The model does not make any predictions other than that the global temperature will increase as a function of P[CO2]. The result is at the intersection of Physics, Atmospheric Science, and Psychology since the demonstration is a powerful tool that will give scientists the impetus to reach out to the public with lucid explanations based on physical principles.\\n   \n",

While submesoscale dynamics are known to impact biological fluxes by modifying nutrient upwelling, horizontal transport has traditionally been assumed to only redistribute phytoplankton without altering concentrations. However, variations in submesoscale dispersion may significantly impact total biogeochemical flux if biological reactions occur during dispersal. By parameterizing the effects of dispersion due to lateral stirring on flux, within an eastern boundary current region, we show that enhanced dispersion yields a near-linear increase in offshore flux, with the magnitude modulated by phytoplankton growth rates and ambient nutrient availability. These findings identify a pathway for improving parameterizations of biogeochemical fluxes, while revealing a source of uncertainty in their prediction by climate models.\\n   \n",

While earlier research has uncovered significant point-source methane emissions from O&G production in the US and Canada, which are key regions with large methane emissions, a comprehensive post-COVID-19 survey has been notably absent. Here, we perform a detailed survey of methane super-emitters across multiple basins of North America (Marcellus Shale US, Haynesville/Bossier Shale US, Permian Delaware Tight US and Montney Play Canada) using the new Chinese Gaofen5-01A/02 (GF5-01A/02) satellite measurements during 2022-2023. We detect 48 extreme methane point-source emissions with flux rates of 646 to 16071 kg h−1. These emissions exhibit a highly skewed and heavy-tailed distribution, constituting approximately 30% of the total flux in sample region, with a range of 13% to 63%. Moreover, we observe a 66.7% reduction in methane emissions in Permian Delaware Tight region during COVID-19, followed by fluctuations until spring 2022. By summer 2023, methane emissions rebound to previous magnitude (0.66 ± 0.20 Tg a−1). Using these point-source surveys, we further quantify a regional methane emission of 1.08±0.02 Tg a-1 in Delaware subbasin. This estimation closely aligns with top-down inversions (0.86±0.03 Tg a-1) from TROPOMI. The upscale estimation underscores the effectiveness of high-resolution remote sensing measurements in improving bottom-up emissions inventories and refining regional methane emission assessments. Our results highlight the potential climate benefits derived from regular monitoring and specific remediation efforts focused on relatively few strong point-source emissions.\\n   \n",

The analysis involves detrending weather data by calculating first differences and then computing the cross-correlation function, or CCF with wind power capacity. The calculations are benchmarked using atmospheric CO2 concentration. The consistency of a significant correlation is tested by detrending using linear residuals and then calculating the CCF on the basis of the residuals, corrected for autocorrelation using the Cochrane-Orcutt procedure [4]. In four cases, where the data were reliable, the analysis provided a clear distinction in favour of wind power as a putative cause of the weather trends, in preference to atmospheric CO2 concentration. Where the quality of the data was less reliable, the outcome was inconclusive. Nevertheless, it would seem that our efforts to mitigate anthropogenic global warning with wind power might well be having a deleterious effect on weather patterns\\n   \n",

These Avicennia-only mangroves have been considered impoverished mangroves controlled by the general latitudinal temperature gradient. The MCO Mediterranean mangroves have been compared with the extant Middle East (ME) mangroves around the Arabian Peninsula, characterized by the dominance of Avicennia and their low diversity. However, these extant communities are not a latitudinal feature but rather an anomaly shaped by extreme environmental conditions (aridity, hypersalinity, sediment supply) that only a few mangrove species can tolerate. In contrast, reconstructed environments for MCO Mediterranean mangroves indicate mild, rainy climates. We conclude that current ME mangroves cannot be considered modern analogs for the MCO Mediterranean mangroves. Finding such modern analogs is challenging, and further studies are recommended to uncover their ecological and biogeographical patterns.\\n   \n",

A growing number of field studies have linked the change in fire regime to post-fire recruitment failure and permanent forest loss. In this study we used four burnt area and two forest loss datasets to calculate the landscape-scale fire return interval (FRI) and associated risk of permanent forest loss. We then used machine learning to predict how the FRI will change under a high emissions scenario (SSP3-7.0) by the end of the century. We found that there is currently 133 000 km2 at high, or extreme, risk of fire-induced forest loss, with a further 3 M km2 at risk by the end of the century.

              "      <td>Identifying and characterising dynamical regime shifts, critical transitions or potential  tipping points in palaeoclimate time series is relevant for improving the understanding of  often highly nonlinear Earth system dynamics. Beyond linear changes in time series  properties such as mean, variance, or trend, these nonlinear regime shifts can manifest  as changes in signal predictability, regularity, complexity, or higher-order stochastic  properties such as multi-stability. In recent years, several classes of methods have been put forward to study these critical  transitions in time series data that are based on concepts from nonlinear dynamics,  complex systems science, information theory, and stochastic analysis. These include approaches such as phase space-based recurrence plots  and recurrence networks, visibility graphs, order pattern-based entropies, and stochastic  modelling. Here, we review and compare in detail several prominent methods from these fields by applying them  to the same set of marine palaeoclimate proxy records of African climate variations during the past  5~million years.  Applying these methods, we observe notable nonlinear transitions in palaeoclimate dynamics  in these marine proxy records and discuss them in the context of important climate events  and regimes such as phases of intensified Walker circulation, marine isotope stage M2,  the onset of northern hemisphere glaciation and the mid-Pleistocene transition.  We find that the studied approaches complement each other by allowing us to point out distinct aspects of dynamical regime shifts in palaeoclimate time series. We also detect significant correlations of these nonlinear regime shift indicators with variations  of Earth's orbit, suggesting the latter as potential triggers of nonlinear transitions in palaeoclimate. Overall, the presented study underlines the potentials of nonlinear time series analysis approaches to provide complementary information on dynamical regime shifts in palaeoclimate and their driving processes that cannot be revealed by linear statistics or eyeball inspection of the data alone.\\n</td>\n",

Based on the most widely used Köppen-Geiger scheme, this article proposes a neural network based climate classification method from a data science perspective. In conventional schemes, empirically handcrafted rules are used to divide climate data into climate types, resulting in certain defects. In the proposed method, a machine learning mechanism is employed to do the task. Specifically, the method first trains a convolutional neural network to fit climate data to land cover conditions, then extracts features from the trained network and finally uses a self-organizing map to cluster land pixels on the extracted features. The method is applied to cluster global land represented by 66,501 pixels (each covers 0.5 latitude degree × 0.5 longitude degree) using 2020 land cover data and 1991-2020 climate normals, and a 4 × 3 × 2 hexagonal self-organizing map clusters the land pixels into twenty-four climate types. By Kappa statistics, the obtained scheme shows good agreement with the Köppen-Geiger and Köppen-Trewartha schemes. In addition, our scheme addresses some issues of the Köppen schemes, suggests new climate types such as As (severe dry-wet season) and Fw (arctic desert), and identifies the highland group H without input of elevation. The proposed method is expected as an intelligent tool to monitor changes in the global climate pattern and to discover new climate types of interest that possibly emerge in the future. It may also be valuable for bio-ecology communities.\\n</td>\n",

Correspondingly, changes in hydrologic regimes could lead to increased drought and occurrence of wildfire. Fire management agencies require information about near-real time wildfire vulnerability in boreal peatlands. Remote sensing tools (e.g., NDVI, NDII) to monitor changing wildfire vulnerability focus on monitoring changes in vascular vegetation and are not necessarily applicable to moss-dominated peatlands. We use time series analysis of Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data to compare the trends in peatlands that have burned to unburned peatlands and show that the Theil-Sen slopes of seasonally decomposed SAR backscatter reflects prolonged drought conditions that can lead to burning. Seasonally decomposed Sentinel-2 NDVI and NDII were also tested but no statistical differences were found between burned and unburned peatlands. Overall, we found that 6 months prior to a wildfire the slope of seasonally decomposed Sentinel-1 VV SAR backscatter was significantly different in burned and unburned peatlands, and can be used to spatially identify fire vulnerability and identify fire-prone areas.\\n</td>\n",

Passive microwave remote sensing allows estimating carbon from deep canopy layers through the Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) parameter. Although their spatial resolution is coarser than that of optical vegetation indices or airborne Lidar data, microwaves present a higher penetration capacity at low frequencies (Lband) and avoid cloud masking. This work compares the relationships of airborne carbon maps in Central and South America with both (i) SMAP L-band VOD at 9 km gridding and (ii) MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Models to estimate carbon stocks are built from these two satellite derived variables. Results show that L-band VOD has a greater capacity to model carbon variability than EVI.

Although the basic science showing that CO2 would absorb the infrared radiation emitted by the earth produce a surface-warming effect was first calculated by Arrhenius in 1896, the issue was neglected by the scientific community for decades. Today there are ample climate models of the climactic effects arising from the forcing term of increasing P[CO2]. In this paper we follow Arrhenius’ concept, although we use the HITRAN database as the input to prove the connection between earth’s surface temperature and atmospheric absorption of terrestrial radiation in a direct manner that the reader can also implement. The spectra of CO2 are enormously complicated, broadened by Fermi Resonance, and intense because of the quantum coupling of the rotation of CO2 to its bending. Using an on-line database for the transitions of CO2 the reader will easily be able to show that CO2 reduces the transmittance of the Earth’s thermal radiation through the atmosphere, which in turn results in heating of the surface. The model does not make any predictions other than that the global temperature will increase as a function of P[CO2]. The result is at the intersection of Physics, Atmospheric Science, and Psychology since the demonstration is a powerful tool that will give scientists the impetus to reach out to the public with lucid explanations based on physical principles.\\n</td>\n",

While submesoscale dynamics are known to impact biological fluxes by modifying nutrient upwelling, horizontal transport has traditionally been assumed to only redistribute phytoplankton without altering concentrations. However, variations in submesoscale dispersion may significantly impact total biogeochemical flux if biological reactions occur during dispersal. By parameterizing the effects of dispersion due to lateral stirring on flux, within an eastern boundary current region, we show that enhanced dispersion yields a near-linear increase in offshore flux, with the magnitude modulated by phytoplankton growth rates and ambient nutrient availability. These findings identify a pathway for improving parameterizations of biogeochemical fluxes, while revealing a source of uncertainty in their prediction by climate models.\\n</td>\n",

While earlier research has uncovered significant point-source methane emissions from O&amp;G production in the US and Canada, which are key regions with large methane emissions, a comprehensive post-COVID-19 survey has been notably absent. Here, we perform a detailed survey of methane super-emitters across multiple basins of North America (Marcellus Shale US, Haynesville/Bossier Shale US, Permian Delaware Tight US and Montney Play Canada) using the new Chinese Gaofen5-01A/02 (GF5-01A/02) satellite measurements during 2022-2023. We detect 48 extreme methane point-source emissions with flux rates of 646 to 16071 kg h−1. These emissions exhibit a highly skewed and heavy-tailed distribution, constituting approximately 30% of the total flux in sample region, with a range of 13% to 63%. Moreover, we observe a 66.7% reduction in methane emissions in Permian Delaware Tight region during COVID-19, followed by fluctuations until spring 2022. By summer 2023, methane emissions rebound to previous magnitude (0.66 ± 0.20 Tg a−1). Using these point-source surveys, we further quantify a regional methane emission of 1.08±0.02 Tg a-1 in Delaware subbasin. This estimation closely aligns with top-down inversions (0.86±0.03 Tg a-1) from TROPOMI. The upscale estimation underscores the effectiveness of high-resolution remote sensing measurements in improving bottom-up emissions inventories and refining regional methane emission assessments. Our results highlight the potential climate benefits derived from regular monitoring and specific remediation efforts focused on relatively few strong point-source emissions.\\n</td>\n",

The analysis involves detrending weather data by calculating first differences and then computing the cross-correlation function, or CCF with wind power capacity. The calculations are benchmarked using atmospheric CO2 concentration. The consistency of a significant correlation is tested by detrending using linear residuals and then calculating the CCF on the basis of the residuals, corrected for autocorrelation using the Cochrane-Orcutt procedure [4]. In four cases, where the data were reliable, the analysis provided a clear distinction in favour of wind power as a putative cause of the weather trends, in preference to atmospheric CO2 concentration. Where the quality of the data was less reliable, the outcome was inconclusive. Nevertheless, it would seem that our efforts to mitigate anthropogenic global warning with wind power might well be having a deleterious effect on weather patterns\\n</td>\n",

These Avicennia-only mangroves have been considered impoverished mangroves controlled by the general latitudinal temperature gradient. The MCO Mediterranean mangroves have been compared with the extant Middle East (ME) mangroves around the Arabian Peninsula, characterized by the dominance of Avicennia and their low diversity. However, these extant communities are not a latitudinal feature but rather an anomaly shaped by extreme environmental conditions (aridity, hypersalinity, sediment supply) that only a few mangrove species can tolerate. In contrast, reconstructed environments for MCO Mediterranean mangroves indicate mild, rainy climates. We conclude that current ME mangroves cannot be considered modern analogs for the MCO Mediterranean mangroves.

As a first application in glaciology, a scenario-neutral approach, using climatic mass balance as a system response, is applied to four glaciers: Hintereisferner (AT), Peyto Glacier (CA), Austre Br\\u221a\\u220fggerbreen (NO) and Abramov Glacier (KGZ). The Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM) is used to perform a scenario-neutral glacier sensitivity analysis, resulting in visual, two-dimensional response surfaces, and a glacier sensitivity index (GSI). In addition, four Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models (CMIP6) (FGOALS3, MPI-ESM1, EG-Earth 3, NorESM2), under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) (1-2.6, 2-4.5, 3-7.0, 5-8.5) are overlaid, for comparison. Assessing results shows that overall, Hintereisferner is most sensitive to changes in climate overall, and temperature especially, with a temperature GSI of 1.12 m w.e./\\u00ac\\u221eC - 1.96 m w.e./\\u00ac\\u221eC, versus, for example, a temperature GSI of 0.56 m w.e./\\u00ac\\u221eC - 0.81 m w.e./\\u00ac\\u221eC for Peyto glacier. Seasonally, we see differences in sensitivity between climatic variables and glaciers, too. Overlaying time slices of the CMIP6 models emphasizes how scenario-neutral approaches are suitable for use in glacier modelling, especially as a framework for sensitivity studies.\\n\",\n          \"While it is difficult, if not impossible, for most humans to conceptualize CO2 levels or ocean temperatures, we are very aware of the growing number of storms and their increase in severity. Indeed, according to the National Weather Service, the number of severe storms has increased in the United States from 1 \\u2013 3/decade in the 1950s through the 1980s, to 8/decade in the 1990s, 30/decade in the 2000s, and 54/decade in the 2010s. Here we argue that a Severe Storm Index (SSI), calculated by dividing the sum of storms/decade by 10, is readily intelligible and can be used as a gauge to inform our behavior as we seek to correct climate change in the United States via a large-scale, fully integrated, \\u201cwar-time like\\u201d effort.\\n\",\n          \"Identifying and characterising dynamical regime shifts, critical transitions or potential  tipping points in palaeoclimate time series is relevant for improving the understanding of  often highly nonlinear Earth system dynamics. Beyond linear changes in time series  properties such as mean, variance, or trend, these nonlinear regime shifts can manifest  as changes in signal predictability, regularity, complexity, or higher-order stochastic  properties such as multi-stability. In recent years, several classes of methods have been put forward to study these critical  transitions in time series data that are based on concepts from nonlinear dynamics,  complex systems science, information theory, and stochastic analysis. These include approaches such as phase space-based recurrence plots  and recurrence networks, visibility graphs, order pattern-based entropies, and stochastic  modelling. Here, we review and compare in detail several prominent methods from these fields by applying them  to the same set of marine palaeoclimate proxy records of African climate variations during the past  5~million years.  Applying these methods, we observe notable nonlinear transitions in palaeoclimate dynamics  in these marine proxy records and discuss them in the context of important climate events  and regimes such as phases of intensified Walker circulation, marine isotope stage M2,  the onset of northern hemisphere glaciation and the mid-Pleistocene transition.  We find that the studied approaches complement each other by allowing us to point out distinct aspects of dynamical regime shifts in palaeoclimate time series. We also detect significant correlations of these nonlinear regime shift indicators with variations  of Earth's orbit, suggesting the latter as potential triggers of nonlinear transitions in palaeoclimate. Overall, the presented study underlines the potentials of nonlinear time series analysis approaches to provide complementary information on dynamical regime shifts in palaeoclimate and their driving processes that cannot be revealed by linear statistics or eyeball inspection of the data alone.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Correct\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Based on the most widely used Köppen-Geiger scheme, this article proposes a neural network based climate classification method from a data science perspective. In conventional schemes, empirically handcrafted rules are used to divide climate data into climate types, resulting in certain defects. In the proposed method, a machine learning mechanism is employed to do the task. Specifically, the method first trains a convolutional neural network to fit climate data to land cover conditions, then extracts features from the trained network and finally uses a self-organizing map to cluster land pixels on the extracted features. The method is applied to cluster global land represented by 66,501 pixels (each covers 0.5 latitude degree × 0.5 longitude degree) using 2020 land cover data and 1991-2020 climate normals, and a 4 × 3 × 2 hexagonal self-organizing map clusters the land pixels into twenty-four climate types. By Kappa statistics, the obtained scheme shows good agreement with the Köppen-Geiger and Köppen-Trewartha schemes. In addition, our scheme addresses some issues of the Köppen schemes, suggests new climate types such as As (severe dry-wet season) and Fw (arctic desert), and identifies the highland group H without input of elevation. The proposed method is expected as an intelligent tool to monitor changes in the global climate pattern and to discover new climate types of interest that possibly emerge in the future. It may also be valuable for bio-ecology communities.\\n   \n",

Correspondingly, changes in hydrologic regimes could lead to increased drought and occurrence of wildfire. Fire management agencies require information about near-real time wildfire vulnerability in boreal peatlands. Remote sensing tools (e.g., NDVI, NDII) to monitor changing wildfire vulnerability focus on monitoring changes in vascular vegetation and are not necessarily applicable to moss-dominated peatlands. We use time series analysis of Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data to compare the trends in peatlands that have burned to unburned peatlands and show that the Theil-Sen slopes of seasonally decomposed SAR backscatter reflects prolonged drought conditions that can lead to burning. Seasonally decomposed Sentinel-2 NDVI and NDII were also tested but no statistical differences were found between burned and unburned peatlands. Overall, we found that 6 months prior to a wildfire the slope of seasonally decomposed Sentinel-1 VV SAR backscatter was significantly different in burned and unburned peatlands, and can be used to spatially identify fire vulnerability and identify fire-prone areas.\\n   \n",

Passive microwave remote sensing allows estimating carbon from deep canopy layers through the Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) parameter. Although their spatial resolution is coarser than that of optical vegetation indices or airborne Lidar data, microwaves present a higher penetration capacity at low frequencies (Lband) and avoid cloud masking. This work compares the relationships of airborne carbon maps in Central and South America with both (i) SMAP L-band VOD at 9 km gridding and (ii) MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Models to estimate carbon stocks are built from these two satellite derived variables. Results show that L-band VOD has a greater capacity to model carbon variability than EVI. The resulting VOD-derived carbon estimates are further presented at a detailed (9 km) spatial scale.\\n   \n",

Although the basic science showing that CO2 would absorb the infrared radiation emitted by the earth produce a surface-warming effect was first calculated by Arrhenius in 1896, the issue was neglected by the scientific community for decades. Today there are ample climate models of the climactic effects arising from the forcing term of increasing P[CO2]. In this paper we follow Arrhenius’ concept, although we use the HITRAN database as the input to prove the connection between earth’s surface temperature and atmospheric absorption of terrestrial radiation in a direct manner that the reader can also implement. The spectra of CO2 are enormously complicated, broadened by Fermi Resonance, and intense because of the quantum coupling of the rotation of CO2 to its bending. Using an on-line database for the transitions of CO2 the reader will easily be able to show that CO2 reduces the transmittance of the Earth’s thermal radiation through the atmosphere, which in turn results in heating of the surface. The model does not make any predictions other than that the global temperature will increase as a function of P[CO2]. The result is at the intersection of Physics, Atmospheric Science, and Psychology since the demonstration is a powerful tool that will give scientists the impetus to reach out to the public with lucid explanations based on physical principles.\\n   \n",

These microbes reduce surface albedo, which, in turn, could lead to warming and enhanced glacier melt. Here we present results from a replicated, controlled field experiment to quantify the impact of microbes on snowmelt in red-snow communities. Addition of nitrogen‚Äìphosphorous‚Äìpotassium fertilizer increased alga cell counts nearly fourfold, to levels similar to nitrogen‚Äìphosphorus-enriched lakes; water alone increased counts by half. The manipulated alga abundance explained a third of the observed variability in snowmelt. Using a normalized-difference spectral index we estimated alga abundance from satellite imagery and calculated microbial contribution to snowmelt on an icefield of 1,900 km2. The red-snow area extended over about 700 km2, and in this area we determined that microbial communities were responsible for 17% of the total snowmelt there. Our results support hypotheses that snow-dwelling microbes increase glacier melt directly in a bio-geophysical feedback by lowering albedo and indirectly by exposing low-albedo glacier ice. Radiative forcing due to perennial populations of microbes may match that of non-living particulates at high latitudes. Their contribution to climate warming is likely to grow with increased melt and nutrient input.\\n   \n",

This paper outlines an environmental flow assessment methodology that explicitly addresses the uncertainty and change inherent in adaptively managing multiple values for management of environmental flows. While non-stationarity and uncertainty are well recognised in the climate literature, these have not been addressed within the structure of environmental flows methodologies. Here, we present an environmental flow assessment that is structured to explicitly consider future change and uncertainty in climate and socio-ecological values, by examining scenarios using ecological models. The environmental flow assessment methodology further supports adaptive management through the intentional integration of participatory approaches and the inclusion of diverse stakeholders. We present a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, highlighting how this methodology facilitates adaptive management. Rethinking our approach to environmental flows assessments is an important step in ensuring that environmental flows continue to work effectively as a management tool under climate change.\\n   \n",

To better address the ramifications of those hazards, now and into the future, the UK needs to transform its scattered, fragmented coastal data resources into a systematic, integrated, quality-controlled, openly accessible data portal. Such a portal would support analyses of coastal risk and resilience by hosting, in addition to data layers for coastal flooding and erosion, a diverse array of spatial datasets for building footprints, infrastructure networks, land use, population, and various socio-economic measures and indicators derived from survey and census data. Rather than prescribe user engagement, the portal would facilitate novel combinations of spatial data layers in order to yield scientifically, societally, and economically beneficial insights into UK coastal systems.\\n   \n",

A record-breaking gigafire event ravaged the western United States (USA) in mid-September 2020, burning 1.2 million acres (4,900 km2) in Oregon and California, and resulting in severe smoke pollution with daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations over 300 ¬µg/m3 for multiple days in many cities. Although previous studies have shown that regional warming escalates wildfire in the western USA, such an unprecedented fire cannot be explained by climate variability alone. Here we show that the synoptic-scale feedback between the wildfires and weather played an unexpectedly important role in accelerating the spread of this fire and also trapped pollutants in the shallow boundary layer over valley cities. Specifically, we find that aerosol-radiation interaction of the smoke plumes over the Cascade Mountains enhanced the downslope winds and weakened the moisture transport, thereby forming a positive feedback loop that amplified the fires and contributed to ~54% of estimated air-pollution related deaths. Our study underscores the complexity of the Earth system and the importance of understanding fundamental mechanisms to effectively mitigate disaster risks in a changing climate.\\n   \n",

However, none of the current commensuration approaches are suitable for addressing the current climatic effect of mire ecosystems as compared to the situation in which such mires would not exist. The mire ecosystems have accumulated carbon for millennia, creating a negative perturbation to the atmospheric carbon dioxide content, but at the same time they emit methane into the atmosphere. Thus, the functioning of mires involves GHG fluxes with opposing effects on Earth’s radiative balance. Here, based on a simple radiative forcing (RF) model, we propose a new metric for commensuration of the effects of accumulated carbon and methane emission (ACME) on Earth’s energy balance. This ACME approach is applicable to natural mires with a significant part of their carbon accumulated more than 1000 years ago and requires relatively few input data. We demonstrate the feasibility of the ACME approach by applying it to a set of northern mires. The ACME-based RF estimate indicates that these mires have a cooling effect on the current climate, contrary to what a global warming potential-based calculation suggests, since the climatic effect is dominated by the sustained carbon accumulation. By applying the new metric with varying estimates of the total carbon storage and methane emission of northern mires, we estimate the current RF of these mires to range from –0.45 to –0.23 W m-2.\\n   \n",

Our Greenland analogue reproduces much of the variability seen in the Greenland ice cores over the last 100 kyr. We also find a strong similarity with the absolutely-dated speleothem record from China, allowing us to place ice core records within an absolute timeframe for the last 400 kyr. The synthetic record provides both a stratigraphic reference and a conceptual basis for assessing the long-term evolution of millennial-scale variability, and its potential role in longer timescale climate change. Indeed, we provide evidence for a ubiquitous association between bipolar seesaw oscillations and glacial terminations throughout the Middle to Late Pleistocene.\\n   \n",

Lithium brine processing requires freshwater, so as lithium exploration increases, accurate estimates of freshwater availability are critical for water management decisions in this region with limited water resources. Here we calculate modern freshwater inflows, such as groundwater recharge and streamflow, for 28 active or prospective lithium-producing basins. We use regional water budget assessments, field streamflow measurements, and global climate and groundwater recharge datasets. Using the freshwater inflow estimates, we calculate water scarcity using the Available Water Remaining methodology. Among all 28 basins, freshwater inflows range from 2 to 33‚Äâmm per year. Our results reveal that commonly used global hydrologic models overestimate streamflow and freshwater availability substantially, leading to inaccurate water scarcity classifications.\\n   \n",

While public and private sector funding is vital, philanthropy offers unique opportunities to support localized, innovative climate solutions. This review explores the current climate finance landscape, identifies the specific needs of Atlantic Canadian communities, and evaluates how philanthropic funding can bridge gaps in financing. It focuses on the impact of philanthropy on climate adaptation and mitigation efforts, emphasizing community resilience and sustainability. While philanthropy can drive positive change, challenges such as equitable resource distribution, fostering systemic change, and empowering marginalized communities must be addressed. Philanthropic organizations should transition from providing short-term, project-focused funding to supporting long-term, transformative initiatives. Collaborative partnerships between governments, businesses, and civil society are key to maximizing impact. Addressing these challenges and embracing innovative approaches will enable philanthropy to serve as a powerful catalyst for climate action, fostering a more environmentally stable future and able to withstand climate challenges for Atlantic Canada and beyond.\\n   \n",

Here we build a unified theoretical framework to describe BC’s mixing states, linking dynamic processes to BC coating thickness distribution, and show its self-similarity for sites in diverse environments. The size distribution of BC-containing particles is found to follow an exponential pattern and is independent of BC core size. A mixing state module is established based on this finding and successfully applied in global and regional models, which increases the accuracy of aerosol climate effect estimations. Our theoretical framework can bridge the gap between observation and model simulation in both mixing state description and light absorption quantification.\\n   \n",

In particular, CWS can provide long-term measurements of urban heat and valuable information on spatio-temporal heterogeneity related to horizontal heat advection. In this study, we make the first compilation of a quasi-climatologic dataset covering 6 years (2015–2020) of hourly near-surface air temperature measurements obtained via 1560 suitable CWS in a domain covering south-east England and Greater London. We investigated the spatio- temporal distribution of urban heat and the influences of local environments on climate, captured by CWS through the scope of Local Climate Zones (LCZ) – a land-use land-cover classification specifically designed for urban climate studies. We further calculate, for the first time, the amount of advected heat captured by CWS located in Greater London and the wider south east England region. We find that London is on average warmer by ∼1.0 ◦C to ∼2.0 ◦C than the rest of south-east England. Characteristics of the southern coastal climate are also captured in the analysis. We find that on average, urban heat advection (UHA) contributes to 0.22 ◦C of the total urban heat in Greater London. Certain areas, mostly in the centre of London are deprived of urban heat through advection since heat is transferred more to downwind suburban areas. UHA can positively contribute to urban heat by up to ∼2.0 ◦C on average and negatively by down to ∼-1.0 ◦C. Our results also show an important degree of inter- and intra-LCZ variability in UHA, calling for more research in the future. Nevertheless, we already find that UHA can impact green areas and reduce their cooling benefit. Such outcomes show the added value of CWS for future urban design.\\n   \n",

Urban greening, such as green roofs and parks, can potentially help address both problems, but the geographical variation of the relative hydrological and thermal performance benefits of such interventions are unknown. Here we quantify globally how climate driven trade-offs exist between modelled hydrological retention and cooling potential of urban greening. Water retention generally increases with aridity in water limited environments, while cooling potential favors lower aridity, energy limited, climates. Urban greening cannot yield high performance simultaneously for addressing both urban heat-island and urban flooding problems in most cities globally. However, in more arid locations, where sustainable, irrigation might be used to improve potential cooling benefits while maintaining retention performance. We demonstrate that as precipitation becomes increasingly variable with climate change, the hydrological and thermal performance of thinner substrates would both diminish more quickly compared to thicker and more deeply vegetated systems, presenting challenges for urban greening strategies. Our results provide a conceptual framework and geographically targeted quantitative guide for urban development, renewal and policymaking.\\n   \n",

These increases have been rationalized from two perspectives. The energetic (or radiative) perspective takes the atmospheric energy budget and decomposes energy flux changes (radiative forcing, feedbacks, or surface fluxes) to determine the energy transport changes required by the budget. The diffusive perspective takes the net effect of atmospheric macroturbulence to be a diffusive energy transport down-gradient, so transport changes can arise from changes in mean energy gradients or turbulent diffusivity. Here, we compare these perspectives in idealized moist, gray-radiation GCM simulations over a wide range of climates. The energetic perspective has a dominant role for radiative forcing in this GCM, with cancellation between the temperature feedback components that account for the GCM's non-monotonic energy transport changes in response to warming. Comprehensive CMIP5 simulations have similarities in the northern hemisphere to the idealized GCM, though a comprehensive GCM over several CO2 doublings has a distinctly different feedback evolution structure. The diffusive perspective requires a non-constant diffusivity to account for the idealized GCM-simulated changes, with important roles for  the eddy velocity, dry static stability, and horizontal energy gradients. Beyond diagnostic analysis, GCM-independent a priori theories for components of the temperature feedback are presented that account for changes without knowledge of a perturbed climate state, suggesting that the energetic perspective is the more parsimonious one.\\n   \n",

Focusing on cleaner cookstoves, we explore the difficulties in using academic studies as benchmarks for evaluations of carbon projects and highlight how methodological choices shape both evaluations and conclusions. Reexamining one influential study on cookstove carbon project overcrediting5, we show that under alternative assumptions consistent with the state of the science estimated overcrediting falls by half. While the overall sector still exhibits worrisome overcrediting, one-fifth of projects analyzed show no clear evidence of it. Enhanced collaboration between researchers and project developers, we argue, is essential for improving the accuracy of carbon market assessments and ensuring that these initiatives deliver genuine social and environmental benefits.\\n   \n",

The C3S Energy service covers different time horizons, for the past 40 years and the future. It provides time series of electricity demand and supply from wind, solar photovoltaic and hydropower, and can be used for recent trends analysis, seasonal outlooks or the assessment of climate change impacts on energy mixes in the long term. This article introduces this service and the resulting dataset, with a focus on the design and validation of the energy conversion models, based on ENTSO-E energy data and the ERA5 climate reanalysis. Flexibility and coherence across all countries have been preferred upon models' accuracy. However, the comparison with ENTSO-E data shows that the models provide plausible energy indicators and, in particular, allow comparing climate variability effects on power demand and generation in a harmonized manner all over Europe.\\n   \n",

Different zonal wind stress anomalies are employed, and their intensity is strengthened or weakened with respect to the climatological value throughout a suite of simulations.   Strengthened (weakened) zonal wind stress anomalies result in increased (decreased) STCs meridional mass and energy transport. Upwelling of subsurface water into the tropics is intensified (reduced), a distinct cold (warm) anomaly appears in the equatorial thermocline and up to the surface, resulting in significant tropical sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies.   Results hold for both subtropical and extratropical anomalies, suggesting the potential impact of mid-latitude atmospheric modes of variability on tropical climate.  Finally, the remotely-driven response is compared with a set of locally-forced simulations, where an equatorial zonal wind stress anomaly is imposed. A dynamically distinct response is achieved, whereby the equatorial thermocline adjusts to the wind stress anomaly resulting in significant equatorial SST anomalies as in the remotely-forced simulations. Significant anomalies in the Indonesian throughflow are generated only when equatorial wind stress anomalies are applied, leading to remarkable heat content anomalies in the Indian Ocean.  Equatorial wind stress anomalies experiments do not involve modifications of STC transports, but could set up the appropriate initial conditions for a tropical-extratropical teleconnection, involving both Hadley cells and STC anomalous transports.\\n   \n",

This article posits that selective science communication and unrealistically optimistic assumptions are obscuring the reality that greenhouse gas emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal will not curtail climate change in the 21st Century. It also explains how overly pessimistic and speculative criticisms are behind opposition to considering potential climate cooling interventions as a complementary approach for mitigating dangerous warming.  There is little evidence supporting assertions that: current greenhouse gas emissions reduction and removal methods can and will be ramped up in time to prevent dangerous climate change; overshoot of Paris Agreement targets will be temporary; net zero emissions will produce a safe, stable climate; the impacts of overshoot can be managed and reversed; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change models and assessments capture the full scope of prospective disastrous impacts; and the risks of climate interventions are greater than the risks of inaction.  These largely unsupported presumptions distort risk assessments and discount the urgent need to develop a viable mitigation strategy. Due to political pressures, many critical scientific concerns are ignored or preemptively dismissed in international negotiations. As a result, the present and growing crisis and the level of effort and time that will be required to control and rebalance the climate are severely underestimated.  In conclusion, the paper outlines the key elements of a realistic policy approach that would augment current efforts to constrain dangerous warming by supplementing current mitigation approaches with climate cooling interventions.\\n   \n",

Recent developments in the literature of NbS have resulted in a body of work addressing questions about knowledge and justice. In line with these developments, this paper proposes the Knowledge and Epistemic Injustice for NbS for Water Framework (KEIN Framework) to identify the production of epistemic injustices in the design of NbS for water management. The KEIN framework draws on questions about knowledge and power raised by Avelino (2021) and five mechanisms that lead to epistemic injustice based on the work by Fricker (2007) and Byskov (2021). We apply the framework to examine a proposal presented to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) that included NbS for water management and Indigenous Peoples in South America. Rather than being an analysis of the project or the GCF per se, the goal of this analysis is to demonstrate the utility of the framework to analyze proposals during the design stage. We argue that proposals submitted to the GCF are reflective of a broadly held international environmental logic. We also identified indications that knowledge was organized and treated in a way that favored external actors at the expense of local actors.  Our analysis also revealed prejudices against people’s epistemic capacities, with potential implications for how the generation of local knowledge is adopted on the ground. The framework illustrates how the design of NbS may minimally disrupt power relations due to the influential role that some actors have in generating knowledge. This study contributes to the operationalization of epistemic justice in designing NbS. Through the application of the proposed framework, the study contributes to future work advancing the construction of epistemically just NbS.\\n   \n",

Despite gaining popularity, studies of various stochastic subgrid scale parameterizations applied to atmospheric climate and weather prediction systems have revealed a diversity of model responses, including degeneracy in the response to different forcings and compensating model errors, with little reduction in artificial damping of the small scales required for numerical stability. Due to the greater range of spatio-temporal scales involved, how to best sample subgrid fluctuations in a computationally inexpensive manner, with the aim of reduced model error and improvements to the simulated climatological state of the ocean, remains an open question. While previous studies have considered perturbations to the surface forcing or subsurface temperature tendencies, we implement an energetically consistent, simple, stochastic subgrid eddy parameterization of the momentum fluxes in regions of the three-dimensional ocean typically associated with high eddy variability.  We consider the changes in the modelled energetics of low-resolution simulations in response to stochastically forced velocity tendencies whose perturbation statistics and amplitudes are calculated from an eddy resolving ocean configuration. Kinetic energy spectra from a triple-decomposition reveal a systematic redistribution from the seasonal (climatological minus mean) potential energy to preferentially generate small scale transient kinetic energy while the total energy spectra remains largely unchanged. We show that stochastic parameterization generally improves model biases, noticeably so for the simulated energetics of the Southern Oceans.\\n   \n",

We analyze one authoritative Pleistocene data set to explore how the climate sensitivity parameter S varies under different system states, using linear regression of mean annual surface temperature changes against CO2 forcing changes.  On the whole data set, S = 2.04K/Wm^(-2) and CO2 forcing explains 64% of the variance in temperature.  Partitioning the data by path (glaciation / de-glaciation); during de-glaciation episodes, S = 2.34K/Wm^(-2), explaining 75% of the temperature variance; during glaciations, S = 1.59K/Wm^(-2) explaining 48% of the temperature variance. Further partitioning into epochs before and after the Marine Isotope Stage 11 424 kaBP (thousand years before present); for de-glaciation paths after 424 kaBP, S = 2.63 K/Wm^(-2) explaining 83% of the variance.  Partitioning into levels of CO2 concentration has much less explanatory power; 20% for concentrations above 210 ppmv and 2% for concentrations below 210 ppmv. These partitions conflate glaciation and de-glaciation episodes and pre/post 424 kaBP epochs.  Possible process-related explanations for the path-related differences are conjectured.  The common assumption that changes in temperature are proportional to changes in CO2 forcing constrains the regression intercept to pass through the origin and inflates the regression error to the extent that the regression model becomes a worse predictor of temperature changes than simply predicting the population mean for all values of CO2 forcing. The consequences of this assumption are substantive in the context of estimating future temperature trajectories and should be carefully weighed.\\n   \n",

However, the impacts of surface water withdrawal for irrigation and its safe operating space remain unclear. We used field measurements and simulation modeling to investigate the effects of irrigation water withdrawal for Boro rice – the most water-consumptive crop that can be grown by farmers – on river water flow and salinity under different climate change and river flow scenarios. Under the baseline conditions of 2015, about 250,000 ha could potentially be irrigated with river water that has salinity levels below 2 dS/m. The impact on river water salinity would be minimal, and only between 0.71 to 1.12% of the cropland would shift from the 0-2 dS/m class to higher salinity levels. Similarly, a minor change in water flow and salinity was simulated for the moderate climate change scenario (RCP 4.5) that forecasts a sea level rise of 22 cm in 2050. Only under the extreme climate change scenario (RCP 8.5), resulting in a sea level rise of 43 cm by 2050, and low flow conditions that are exceeded in 90 percent of the cases, the 2 dS/m isohaline would move landward by 64 to 105 km in March and April for the Tentulia and Buriswar Rivers. This would expose an additional 36.6% of potentially irrigable cropland to salinity levels of 2 to 4 dS/m.  However, Boro rice is already well established by that time and can tolerate greater levels. We conclude that there is considerable scope to expand irrigated crop production without negatively exposing the cropland and rivers to detrimental salinization levels while preserving the ecosystem services of the rivers.\\n   \n",

Accelerating research on this topic is critical in view of rapid climate change driven by anthropogenic activities. Over the last two decades, we have improved our understanding of how mass distribution on the Earth‚Äôs surface, in particular changes in ice and water distribution linked to glacial cycles, affects mantle melting, crustal magmatic processing and eruption rates. New hypotheses on the impacts of climate change on eruption processes have also emerged, including how eruption style and volcanic plume rise are affected by changing surface and atmospheric conditions, and how volcanic sulfate aerosol lifecycle, radiative forcing and climate impacts are modulated by background climate conditions. Future improvements in past climate reconstructions and current climate observations, volcanic eruption records and volcano monitoring, and numerical models will contribute to boost research on climate-volcano impacts. Important mechanisms remain to be explored, such as how changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation will affect the volcanic ash lifecycle. Fostering a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to climate-volcano impacts is critical to gain a full picture of how ongoing climate changes may affect the environmental and societal impacts of volcanic activity.\\n   \n",

Machine learning has been applied to the weather station data to develop a prediction model. The preliminary results are promising and encouraging and are envisaging to further this research towards the determination of unknown temperature rise in the region. This is important to mention here, that the problem has been formulated as a Regression problem, NOT as a classification problem. Hence, applying Convolutional neural networks is not possible, due to the non-existence of classes or converting the temperature values to classes does not make any sense. Hence, this is defined as a regression problem which achieved encouraging desirable results.\\n   \n",

One arising technique is the use of machine-learning (ML) models. In this study we explore its opportunities to project sub-national armed conflict risk for three shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) scenarios and three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) by 2040-2050 in Africa, using the novel and open-source ML framework CoPro. Results are consistent with the underlying socio-economic storylines of the SSPs, and the resulting out-of-sample armed conflict projections obtained with RandomForest classifiers agree with comparable studies. In SSP1-RCP2.6, conflict risk is low or absent in most regions, although the Horn of Africa and parts of Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique continue to be conflict-prone. Conflict risk intensifies in the more severe SSP3-RCP6.0 scenario, especially in central Africa and large parts of western Africa. We specifically assessed the role of hydro-climatic indicators as drivers of armed conflict. Overall, their importance is limited but can differ locally depending on the overall sign of climate change impact and the contextual (socio-economic) factors defining the overall magnitude of those impacts. With our study being at the forefront of ML applications for conflict risk projections, we have identified various challenges for this arising scientific field. A major concern is the inconsistent data availability of observed conflict events as well as of socio-economic indicators for the various SSPs. Nevertheless, ML models such as the one presented here are a viable way forward in the field of armed conflict risk projections, and can help to inform the policy-making process with respect to climate security.\\n   \n",

The computer model environment allows us to strictly control for variables such as sea surface temperature (SST), foraminifera species abundance response to SST, as well as depositional processes such as sediment accumulation rate (SAR) and bioturbation depth (BD), and subsequent laboratory processes such as sample size and machine error. Examining a number of best-case scenarios, we find that IFA-derived reconstructions of past SST variability are sensitive to all of the aforementioned variables. Running 100 ensembles for each scenario, we find that the influence of bioturbation upon IFA-derived SST reconstructions, combined with typical samples sizes employed in the field, produces noisy SST reconstructions with poor correlation to the original SST distribution in the water. This noise is especially apparent for values near the edge of the SST distribution, which is the distribution region of particular interest for, e.g., ENSO. The noise is further increased in the case of increasing machine error, decreasing SAR and decreasing sample size. We also find poor agreement between ensembles, underscoring the need for replication studies in the field to confirm findings at particular sites and time periods. Furthermore, we show that a species‚Äô abundance response to SST could in theory bias IFA-derived SST reconstructions, which can have consequences when comparing IFA-derived SST from markedly different mean climate states. We provide a number of idealised simulations spanning a number of SAR, sample size, machine error and species abundance scenarios, which can help assist researchers in the field to determine under which conditions they could expect to retrieve significant results.\\n   \n",

Spatially explicit economic models usually describe human activities and ensuing land-use dynamics at a resolution that this is too coarse (typically 10-1000 regions) to understand how these affect many biophysical processes, including ecosystem service supply (which requires billions of 300m or finer grid-cells). Several land-use change models exist that allocate coarse land-use changes at finer spatial scales, but there is no general, global, computationally tractable tool for downscaling to the spatial scale appropriate for understanding landscape and ecosystem change across different land-system scenarios. Here, we present a new model, the Spatial Economic Allocation Landscape Simulator (SEALS), which generates global, high resolution land-use, land-cover maps from coarse projections of land-use change. SEALS advances land-use change modeling research in several ways: it uses a novel machine-learning algorithm to empirically calibrate its parameters; it is a generalized approach that can be applied to very different types of projections within earth-economy models; and it is computationally efficient, generating global results at 300m resolution in approximately 1 hour on a laptop computer. We develop SEALS, and apply it to downscale 6 global scenarios of land-use change from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to 300m resolution, which we make publicly available, allowing researchers to project global, fine-scale changes in ecosystem services. For carbon storage and sequestration, we find that, from 2021 to 2100, the SSPs considered result in reductions in carbon storage and sequestration by 3-21%, and baseline results are 9.17% lower than conventional estimates using low-resolution inputs. Consistent with prior estimates, we find that SSPs 3 and 4, which lead to large amounts of tropical deforestation, result in the largest carbon losses, further exacerbating the climate impacts.\\n   \n",

At remote lake-rich landscapes, ability to implement and maintain long-term monitoring is often challenged by logistical and financial constraints. At the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD; northeastern Alberta, Canada), an internationally recognized remote freshwater landscape threatened by climate change and upstream industrial development (hydroelectric regulation of river flow, oil sands mining and processing), the need for an integrated aquatic ecosystem monitoring program has long been recognized to track changes to the flood regime, water balance, water quality, and contaminant deposition in the abundant shallow lakes. The remoteness and hydrological complexity of the landscape, among other factors, have hindered the implementation of such a program. In recent years, concern over aquatic ecosystem degradation has led to renewed and urgent calls by international and national governance agencies for implementation of a long-term monitoring program. Here, we report on intensive, multi-faceted research performed during 2015-2021 at 60 lakes spanning the delta’s broad hydroecological gradients to develop, evaluate, and apply a framework for integrated assessment of status and trends in water balance, water chemistry and contaminant enrichment. We present the design and approaches used, synthesize the knowledge gained from data collected during the 7-year-long research phase, and provide a foundation for a long-term aquatic ecosystem monitoring program that addresses several recommendations stemming from assessments by UNESCO and key priorities within the Wood Buffalo National Park Action Plan. We suggest the monitoring framework is readily transferable to other remote shallow lake- and pond-rich landscapes threatened by multiple potential stressors.\\n   \n",

Using reanalysis and two large-ensemble datasets from CESM1 and GFDL-CM3, we investigate the following: The climatology of 3D structure, physical processes governing the temperature anomaly associated with blocks, ability of GCMs to reproduce the 3D structure, and its response to RCP8.5. In reanalysis, over both ocean and land, the anomalous winds are equivalent-barotropic in the troposphere and stratosphere, and temperature anomalies are positive throughout the troposphere and negative in the lower stratosphere. The main seasonal and regional differences are that blocks are larger/stronger in winters, and over oceans, the temperature anomaly is shifted westward due to latent heating. Analyzing the temperature tendency equation shows that in all three sectors, adiabatic warming due to subsidence is the main driver of the positive temperature anomaly; however, depending on season and region, meridional thermal advection and latent heating might have leading-order contributions too. Both GCMs are found to reproduce the climatological 3D structure remarkably well, but sometimes disagree on future changes. Overall, the future summertime response is weakening of all fields (except for specific humidity), although the impact on near-surface temperature is not necessarily weakened; e.g., the blocking-driven near-surface warming over Russia intensifies. The wintertime response is strengthening of all fields, except for temperature in some cases. Responses of geopotential height and temperature are shifted westward in winters, most likely due to latent heating.\\n   \n",

But whilst geoscientists are being encouraged - and, increasingly, trained - to ‘go public’ with our science, what is less clear is to what extent our current geo-communications are effectively addressing the long-term planetary concerns that confront society.  In this paper we argue that scientists are the interface between the research organisations that produce knowledge and the wider public who could use that knowledge, and, in that regard, are akin to marketers in the business world. Drawing from the dominant paradigms that shape business marketing, we re-consider the prevailing models of science communication and their consequent sense of purpose. We identify three dominant approaches of marketing-led science communication: ‘make-and-sell’; ‘sense-and-respond’; and ‘guide-and-co-create’. We judge the first two to be incompatible with delivering long-term sustainability, in contrast to the emergent guide-and-co-create mode - purpose-driven, interdisciplinary, participatory, and reflexive - which we contend is best placed to tackle long-term geo-environmental concerns through having a clear wellbeing- focused objective whilst co-creating the path to achieving it.  We conclude with the contention that adopting a guide-and-co-create approach to science communications will require not only rethinking communication practice within universities but also radical institutional regime change towards universities becoming purpose-driven organisations.\\n   \n",

Using a fully nonlinear, Boussinesq propagation model, we examine the buffering capacity of the Great Barrier Reef against tsunamis triggered by several hypothetical sources: a series of far-field, Solomon Islands earthquake sources of various magnitudes (Mw 8.0, Mw 8.5, and Mw 9.0), a submarine landslide source that has previously been documented in the offshore geological record (i.e. the Gloria Knolls Slide), and a potential future landslide source (i.e. the Noggin Block). We show that overall, the Great Barrier Reef acts as a large-scale regional buffer due to the roughness of coral cover and the complex bathymetric features (i.e. platforms, shoals, terraces, etc.) that corals construct over thousands of years. However, the buffering effect of coral cover is much stronger for tsunamis that are higher in amplitude. When coral cover is removed, the largest earthquake scenario (Mw 9.0) exhibits up to a 31% increase in offshore wave amplitude and estimated run-up. These metrics increase even more for landslide scenarios, where they tend to double. These discrepancies can be explained by the higher bed particle velocities incited by higher-amplitude waves, which leads to greater frictional dissipation at a seabed covered by coral. At a site-specific level, shoreline orientation relative to the reef platforms also determines the degree of protectiveness against both types of tsunamis, where areas situated behind broad, shallow, coral-covered platforms benefit the most. Additionally, we find that the platforms, rather than gaps in the offshore reef structure, tend to amplify wave trains through wave focussing when coral cover is removed from simulations. Our findings have implications for future tsunami hazards along the northeastern Australian coastline, particularly as the physiological stressors imposed by anthropogenic climate change further exacerbate coral die-off and reductions in ecosystem complexity. Therefore, areas that experience a protective benefit by the Great Barrier Reef‚Äôs platforms could be disproportionately more vulnerable in the future.\\n   \n",

The ClimHB conceptual framework, developed in 2019, integrates two influential models: the Levesque model of healthcare access and DFID's resilience framework. Designed to study health system resilience in response to climate-induced events, the ClimHB framework uniquely positions the population as an active participant on the demand side, complementing the supply side of health services and providers. Characterised by three core dimensions – exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity – this dual focus on demand and supply, and their interactions emphasises the dynamic interplay between both sides in shaping health system resilience. A workshop utilising framework analysis, and the World Café method refined the ClimHB framework by integrating empirical evidence from Haiti and Bangladesh, alongside insights from a literature review. The revised framework presents a dynamic understanding of interrelated resilience, aimed at informing decision-making across all levels of healthcare. It emphasises the importance of contextual factors, strengthens outcome linkages, and incorporates socio-economic and ecological considerations. Governance, professional awareness, and supply-side feedback loops were also emphasised. Site studies demonstrated the framework’s adaptability and ability to foster synergy between theory and implementation. However, challenges persist in operationalising the framework, particularly for policymakers, emphasising the need for validation, standardised measures, and a deeper understanding of resilience interplays. Future research should explore the framework’s implications for structural management, training, and resource allocation, addressing critical gaps in resilience research.\\n   \n",

The Choco low-level jet is emblematic of broader westerly winds in this region and is projected to weaken by the end of the 21st century, but climate models show considerable disagreement about the extent of weakening. Using contemporary observations, we demonstrate that the configuration of westerly winds in the eastern equatorial Pacific is reflected by hydrogen isotopes in precipitation (Œ¥Dp ) in Ecuador. As westerly winds strengthen, Œ¥D p increases from greater transport of enriched Œ¥D vapor from the Eastern Pacific Warm Pool. We apply this framework to a new record of reconstructed Œ¥Dp using leaf waxes in ocean sediments off the coast of Ecuador (ODP1239, 0 ‚ó¶ 40.32 0 S, 82 ‚ó¶ 4.86 0 W) that span the Plio-Pleistocene. Low Œ¥D p in the early Pliocene indicates weak westerly water vapor transport in a warmer climate state, which is attributed to a low sea surface temperature gradient between the cold tongue and off-equatorial regions in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Near the end-Pliocene (Àú3 Ma), westerly water vapor transport weakens, possibly from shifts in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, forced by high latitude Northern Hemisphere cooling. In complementary isotope-enabled climate simulations, a weak Choco jet and westerly water vapor transport in the early Pliocene are matched by a decrease in Œ¥D p and hydroclimate changes in the northern tropical Andes. Precipitation from the Choco jet can cause deadly landslides and weakened westerly winds in the early Pliocene implies a southward shift of these hazards along the Pacific coast of the northern tropical Andes in the future.\\n   \n",

Earth System Data Cubes (ESDCs) have become an essential tool in Earth System Sciences (ESS) by organizing large-scale, multivariate environmental datasets into a structured, scalable and analysis-ready format. However, modern machine learning techniques are not yet being utilized to their full potential on ESDCs. This is due to the lack of proper tooling, domain-specific challenges, and high barriers of entry for practitioners. We introduce ml4xcube, an open-source Python framework designed to assist ESS domain experts in applying ML techniques on ESDCs for advanced analysis and prediction of environmental variables and impacts. Through a comprehensive suite of tools, it addresses specific challenges associated with the nature of ESS data, such as the non-uniform data distribution due to dynamic gaps, or spatio-temporal autocorrelation of environmental variables. Due to its modular architecture, it covers the complete analysis process, from data exploration, and preparation, to model development, result interpretation and evaluation. With support for distributed computing, it handles large ESDC datasets efficiently. In order to ease the adoption it includes extensive documentation and tutorial notebooks. We demonstrate ml4xcube’s capabilities through three examples, showcasing its potential and capabilities for integrating machine learning with ESDC data.\\n   \n",

We elicit judgements on natural science research priorities for solar geoengineering through a survey and in-person discussion with 72 subject matter experts, including two thirds of all scientists with ‚â•10 publications on the topic. Experts prioritized Earth system response (33%) and impacts on society and ecosystems (27%) over the human and social dimensions (17%) and developing or improving solar geoengineering methods (15%), with most allocating no effort to weather control or counter-geoengineering. While almost all funding to date has focused on geophysical modeling and social sciences, our experts recommended substantial funding for observations (26%), perturbative field experiments (16%), laboratory research (11%) and engineering for deployment (11%). Of the specific proposals, stratospheric aerosols received the highest average priority (34%) then marine cloud brightening (17%) and cirrus cloud thinning (10%). The views of experts with ‚â•10 publications were generally consistent with experts with <10 publications, though when asked to choose the radiative forcing for their ideal climate scenario only 40% included solar geoengineering compared to 70% of experts with <10 publications. This suggests that those who have done more solar geoengineering research are less supportive of its use in climate policy. We summarize specific research recommendations and challenges that our experts identified, the most salient of which were fundamental uncertainties around key climate processes, novel challenges related to solar geoengineering as a design problem, and the challenges of public and policymaker engagement.\\n   \n",
              "61  Climate change influences both average states and extremes in temperatures and precipitation. Southeast Asia, one of the most vulnerable regions worldwide to floods and heatwaves, indicates an escalation of the possibility of severe climate extremes. Extreme precipitation events can bring increasing floods, leading to considerable damage to property and human well-being. However, droughts also occur in Southeast Asia due to changing precipitation patterns in different regions. In big cities, such damages and risks are highly influential, given the large population density and the proximity to the coast or rivers. Global Earth system models predict the average trends and extremes of the climate system, including record-shattering extreme events that have exceeded previous records. I use the recently released Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), a multi-model large ensemble of climate predictions under different scenarios, to investigate changes in climate conditions in ten highly populated Southeast Asian cities. I first evaluated the CMIP6 simulations in the present day (2005-2014) in the ten cities and found good consistency in temperature and precipitation. Then, I examine changes in the mean, minimum, and maximum temperature and precipitation on an annual, monthly, and daily basis, respectively, under the high-emission SSP5-8.5 scenario. Furthermore, in the late century, annual maximum temperatures hit more than 40 °C in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and Vientiane. Cities in our study are projected to experience 5-6 °C increases in temperature from November to April, indicating significant changes in the seasonal cycle. Precipitation increases significantly from May to October in most large cities in our study, except for Johor Bahru, Malaysia, where some summer precipitation reductions are expected. Yangon, in particular, is projected to increase more than 4 millimeters per day in July, indicating a very high challenge from flooding as a city facing flood risk every year at present. In summary, our results indicate significant changes in the mean and extreme states of temperature and precipitations in Southeast Asia. Based on these, I identified major physical risks of climate change among the ten cities. Decision-makers should build resilience to these risks to avoid significant damage. Yukiko Hirabayashi et al. (2013) discovered that the risks of floods increase due to the degree of warming. Increasing floods might lead to damage to households and other organisms. Moreover, a greater incidence of climate change, such as droughts, in Southeast Asia is caused by decreasing precipitation in regions (Teerachai Amnuaylojaroen and Pavinee Chanvichit (2019)). This investigation particularly utilizes CMIP6 model simulations to predict the future pattern of climate extremes based on historical and present statistics. CMIP6 performs well in reproducing the climatological spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation, with better performance for temperature than precipitation to predict near future and future climate extremes is that it (Yang et al. for China). With large-ensemble data for climate extremes, CMIP6 can predict more precise climate extremes. This model is necessary for research about extreme climate, as it addresses the climate system's natural variability in different regions with different topographic features.\\n   \n",

As gender roles, culture, age, physical and physiological characteristics increase, mainly Nepalese women's and children's, health risks associated with climate change and air pollution, listening to and learning from women is critical. This study explores women's perspectives and lived experiences concerning climate change, consequent adverse impacts on agriculture and health, and ongoing adaptation and mitigation strategies. Assessing perspectives and lived experiences related to climate change can offer opportunities to explore understanding, local beliefs, experiences with adverse impacts and adaptation. We used a descriptive qualitative approach. An equal number of focus group discussions (FGDs, n=8) and key-informant interviews (KIIs, n=8) were conducted. Purposive and snowball sampling were used to recruit participants. Four research assistants with public health backgrounds and climate change training were employed to assist with this work. All interviews were conducted in the Nepali language using an interview guide. All KIIs and FGDs were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim in Nepali. Data were analyzed in NVivo 1.7 using content analysis. Forty-two of the 48 participants identified as women. The largest proportion of participants was aged greater than or equal to 50 years (18/48), had no formal education (21/48), and were either older women (>55 years) (13/48) or mothers of children younger than five (11/48). Three main topical areas emerged from the FGDs and KIIs: (i) the winds of change, (ii) the unpredictability of weather, and (iii) acting locally. The study provides insights into how women and children in rural communities in a Nepali hill district experience, adapt and mitigate climate change impacts. These findings can help inform the development of interventions to better address women's and children's needs and concerns, essential to promoting well-being and reducing impacts exacerbated by climate change.\\n   \n",

Currently, mitigating issues related to the lack of water has become an aim for the public and private sectors. Water scarcity can be estimated by the ratio between water use (withdrawal or consumption) and water availability (a minimum discharge), named Water Stress Index (WSI). But some uncertainties can influence the perception of water scarcity, such as population growth, land cover, climate changes, uncontrolled water use, and the scale at which the WSI is evaluated. To improve the knowledge about water management in two basins in eastern Legal Amazon, We estimated WSI at unit-catchments scale from MGB hydrologic model, water use data, and climate change projections. Our results showed a safe water situation in most parts of the basins, but first-order unit-catchments need more attention due to high WSI values being able to compromise downstream water use.\\n   \n",

However, it is still unclear how global this climate variability was because of the scarce meteorological data availability in other regions including East Asia, especially around the 17th century. In this context, Seungjeongwon Ilgi, a daily record of the Royal Secretariat of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea, is a precious source of historical meteorological records for the Korean Peninsula, as it covers 288 years of weather observations made during 1623-1910. We used the digital database of Seungjeongwon Ilgi to construct a machine-readable weather condition dataset. To this end, we extracted valid weather information from the original weather description text and compiled them into predefined weather categories. Additionally, we attempted to improve the usability of the dataset by converting the reported dates in the traditional calendar system to those in the Gregorian calendar. Finally, we outlined the promising implications of this dataset for meteorological and climatological studies, while describing the limitations of the dataset.

However, lack of confidence in geologic CO2 storage security remains a barrier to CCS implementation. Here we present a numerical program that calculates CO2 storage security and leakage to the atmosphere over 10,000 years. This combines quantitative estimates of geological subsurface CO2 retention, and of surface CO2 leakage. We calculate that realistically well-regulated storage in regions with moderate well densities has a 50% probability that leakage remains below 0.0008% per year, with over 98% of the injected CO2 retained in the subsurface over 10,000 years. An unrealistic scenario, where CO2 storage is inadequately regulated, estimates that more than 78% will be retained over 10,000 years. Our modelling results suggest that geological storage of CO2 can be a secure climate change mitigation option, but we note that long-term behaviour of CO2 in the subsurface remains a key uncertainty.\\n   \n",

However, the impact of changes in precipitation amount and distribution on future glacier change remains uncertain because mesoscale meteorology is not represented in current models that project glacier change. We explored the combined effects of past and future changes in air temperature and precipitation amount and distribution on the evolution of Khumbu Glacier in the Everest region of Nepal—a benchmark glacier in the monsoon-influenced Nepal Himalaya—using a climate-glacier modelling approach that forces an ice-dynamical glacier evolution model with a surface mass balance forcing that includes mesoscale meteorological variables derived from downscaling of Regional Climate Model outputs. Our simulations show that historical warming during the late Holocene has committed Khumbu Glacier to future volume loss of 10–23% during this century. Under moderate future warming (RCP4.5) from the present day, Khumbu Glacier could lose 70% volume by 2100 CE due to increasing air temperatures. However, the projected increase in precipitation in tandem with climate warming could offset half of this loss, such that the total decrease in glacier volume by 2100 CE compared to the present day is only 34%. Extreme future warming (RCP8.5) will not be compensated by  changes in precipitation but will instead result in substantial ablation above 6,000 m, causing the highest glacier on Earth to vanish between 2160–2260 CE.\\n   \n",

CORDEX Africa has been developed to forecast Africa's climate variation and variabilities. the RCA4 regional climate model performance of CORDEX Africa domains have not been evaluated yet. Therefore, this finding is aimed to evaluate RCA4 CORDEX Africa RCMs performance in the Gilgal Gibe Watershed, Omo basin, Ethiopia. The observed rainfall and temperature data for five stations obtained from National Metrological Agent were used for bias correction of the RCMs. First the accuracy of simulation results was evaluated using as suite of statistical measures such as Bias, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient, and the result was found that the performance of model is satisfactory.

The most common method for determining spatial wind speed patterns in cities relies on numerical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, which resolve Navier-Stokes equations around buildings. While effective, these simulations are computationally intensive and require specialised expertise, limiting their broader applicability. To address these limitations, this study proposes a more cost-effective alternative while maintaining the accuracy and spatial patterns captured by CFD. We developed a machine learning (ML) approach to predict wind speed patterns from prevailing wind directions and three- dimensional urban morphology, which are increasingly available for global cities. The model is trained and tested using a comprehensive dataset of 512 numerical simulations of urban neighbourhoods, representing diverse morphological configurations in cities worldwide. We find that the ML algorithm accurately predicts complex wind patterns, achieving a normalised mean absolute error of less than 10%, which is comparable to wind anemometer measurement in a low wind speed environment. In predicting wind statistics, the ML model also surpasses that of regression models based solely on statistical representations of urban morphology. The R2 values measuring grid-level agreement between ML and CFD range from 0.94-0.99 and 0.65-0.95, respectively, for the idealised and whole datasets. However, we find that grid-based R2 is not an effective metric for evaluating the 2D model performance due to localised biases arising from faster wind speed grid regions, which is revealed by the wind probability density function. This further confirms the suitability of the ML models for capturing wind distributions at pedestrian height. These findings demonstrate that complex pedestrian wind patterns can be effectively predicted using an image-based ML approach, circumventing the need to resolve complex physical equations directly.\\n   \n",

However, the continent faces challenges with groundwater scarcity due to factors like population growth, climate change, and over exploitation. Over the past ten years, machine learning has been increasingly and successfully used in groundwater level prediction across the world. This review paper explores the application of machine learning techniques in predicting groundwater levels in Africa. The methodology involved downloading relevant papers, identifying and categorizing the machine learning algorithms employed, and quantifying their use. Geological and climatic variables were also identified, analyzed and categorized to measure their usage frequency. The different algorithms and input variables extracted from each paper are graphically represented in this document highlighting the most employed ones. The findings suggest that the available literature on this topic in Africa is limited compared to the rest of the world. Tree-based algorithms are commonly used in machine learning in Africa, and the most employed input variables are related to geomorphology and temperature.

But Global climate models run at coarse spatial resolution which is difficult to do regional analysis. Regional-scale projections can be obtained by a technique called statistical downscaling which uses past data to find out the high resolution and low-resolution mapping. There are many methods for statistical downscaling of climate data: 1) Conventional methods 2) Deep learning architecture. Some of the existing works like DeepSd downscaled High-resolution climate projections but in such cases, Global climate model (GCM) data suffers from concept drift, change of mapping between input and label over time. So applying these deep learning models is not a good idea for statistical downscaling. In our study, we have developed new approach of downscaling which outperforms other deep learning architectures like super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN), Long short term memory network (LSTM) in terms of accuracy and reliability. These existing models focus on minimizing the root mean square error (RMSE ) and do not take care of the tails or extremes. Therefore the objective function of these models should be changed other than root mean square error (RMSE). Our proposed model focuses on both means and extremes.

As a first application in glaciology, a scenario-neutral approach, using climatic mass balance as a system response, is applied to four glaciers: Hintereisferner (AT), Peyto Glacier (CA), Austre Br√∏ggerbreen (NO) and Abramov Glacier (KGZ). The Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM) is used to perform a scenario-neutral glacier sensitivity analysis, resulting in visual, two-dimensional response surfaces, and a glacier sensitivity index (GSI). In addition, four Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models (CMIP6) (FGOALS3, MPI-ESM1, EG-Earth 3, NorESM2), under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) (1-2.6, 2-4.5, 3-7.0, 5-8.5) are overlaid, for comparison. Assessing results shows that overall, Hintereisferner is most sensitive to changes in climate overall, and temperature especially, with a temperature GSI of 1.12 m w.e./¬∞C - 1.96 m w.e./¬∞C, versus, for example, a temperature GSI of 0.56 m w.e./¬∞C - 0.81 m w.e./¬∞C for Peyto glacier. Seasonally, we see differences in sensitivity between climatic variables and glaciers, too. Overlaying time slices of the CMIP6 models emphasizes how scenario-neutral approaches are suitable for use in glacier modelling, especially as a framework for sensitivity studies.\\n   \n",

However, future drought changes in Australia ‚Äìthe driest inhabited continent on Earth‚Äì have remained stubbornly uncertain due to a lack of model agreement in projected precipitation changes in most regions. We use an ensemble of future projections from the National Hydrological Projections to assess future drought changes in Australia. The ensemble of 32 simulations was created using the Australian Landscape Water Balance model (AWRA-L) forced by four global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 that were downscaled and bias-corrected using four alternative methods. This ensemble provided an opportunity to analyse multiple sources of uncertainty on the future projections and quantify changes across multiple drought types (meteorological, hydrological and agricultural). We show future increases in the time spent under drought for all three drought types, with largest increases projected in winter and spring. The future changes are particularly robust in the highly populated and agricultural regions of Australia, suggesting potential impacts on agricultural activities, ecosystems and urban water supply. We attributed uncertainty in future drought changes to GCMs, downscaling/bias correction methods and emissions scenarios. GCMs represent the largest source of uncertainty but the choice of downscaling method is also important. The emissions scenarios were the lowest source of uncertainty but influenced the magnitude and spatial extent of robust future changes. Overall, the projections suggest likely future increases in drought in Australia with little evidence for ameliorating drought risk with climate change despite ongoing uncertainty in future changes in parts of the country.\\n   \n",

Glacier area is an essential climate variable but its tracking is complicated by the labour-intensive manual digitisation of satellite imagery. Here we introduce ICEmapper, a deep learning model that maps glacier outlines from Sentinel-1 time series with accuracy on par with human experts. We used this model to retrieve Svalbard glacier outlines for 2016‚Äì2024 and found a tripling of the glacier area loss rate (-260 km2 p.a.) in the last decade as compared to that previously reported for 1980‚Äì2010 (-80 km2 p.a.). This acceleration is largely driven by increased calving at tidewater glaciers and the climatic warming signal impacting land-terminating glaciers. Additionally, our analysis shows significant area changes related to glacier surging, namely, the Nathorstbreen system and Austfonna, Basin-3 surges. These two surges collectively added to the area change in 2006‚Äì2016 (+194.30 km2 or +0.59%), thus delaying the regionwide area loss by approximately two years. Our results indicate a significant acceleration in glacier area loss in Svalbard, and we anticipate broader applications of our method to track glacier changes on larger scales.\\n   \n",

The arid climate, sparse vegetation and low topographic relief result in very high interferometric coherence magnitude between most pairs of dates, even for those separated by multiple years. For pairs of dates with differing soil moisture conditions, such as a “dry” date and a date immediately following one of the precipitation events, the interferometric coherence magnitude is much lower.  However, pairs spanning the same event, but with a longer time interval, have high interferometric coherence magnitude.  This observation suggests that the phase changes that result in lower coherence for some pairs are not permanent, such as those that would result from erosion or deposition of material, but are due to the variations in soil moisture.   In support of this view, when we compare the phase of individual pixels to their neighbors, we observe similar phase change trends for each precipitation event. We present a simple statistical model of the relationship between soil moisture and phase, and show that it predicts the observed coherence and phase histories within this particular SAR time series.  We also show how the parameters of this relationship can be inferred from the InSAR observables, and can be used to reduce the soil moisture effects on coherence and phase even for pairs of dates that were not used in that parameter estimation.  For the test data considered here, the noise associated with soil moisture is lowered by 40%. We present results for synthetic time series, including a demonstration of the widely-observed phenomenon that displacement rates inferred from InSAR time series depend on the choice of interferometric pairs used in the analysis.\\n   \n",

This stratification is a key attribute of the region as it acts as an effective barrier for the vertical exchanges of Atlantic Water heat, nutrients, and CO2 between intermediate depths and the surface of the Eurasian and Amerasian basins (EB and AB). Observations show that from 1970 to 2017, the stratification in the AB has strengthened, whereas, in parts of the EB, the stratification has weakened. The strengthening in the AB is linked to freshening and deepening of the halocline. In the EB, the weakened stratification is associated with salinification and shoaling of the halocline (Atlantification). Simulations from a suite of CMIP6 models project that, under a strong greenhouse-gas forcing scenario (ssp585), the overall surface freshening and warming continue in both basins, but there is a divergence in hydrographic trends in certain regions. Within the AB, there is agreement among the models that the upper layers will become more stratified. However, within the EB, models diverge regarding future stratification. This is due to different balances between trends at the surface and trends at depth, related to Fram Strait fluxes. The divergence affects projections of future state of Arctic sea ice, as models with the strongest Atlantification project the strongest decline in sea ice volume in the EB. From these simulations, one could conclude that Atlantificaton will not spread eastward into the AB; however, we need to improve models to simulate tendencies in a more delicately stratified EB correctly.\\n   \n",

However, extensive amount of energy is required to produce one kilogram of tea, making tea processing energy-intensive. Comparing greenhouse gas emissions from different types of energy consumed in tea factories is imperative to enable policymakers make informed intervention in emission reduction. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in tea factories is one of the pathways to meeting Kenya’s nationally determined 32% reduction of carbon emissions by 2030 and commitment to the Paris Agreement. This paper assesses greenhouse gas emissions from different sources of energy used in four tea factories in Kenya. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission factor is used to calculate the total emissions of each type of energy used for 5 years. Life cycle assessment using simapro software is used to assess the specific compound causing the emission. The findings reveal that the 5-year greenhouse gas emissions by biogas, solar, wood, briquettes, and electricity are 336,111, 7,108, 20,201.06, and 1,338.28 kg CO2/kWh, respectively. Firewood has the highest concentration of carbon dioxide, while solar energy has the least. Analysis of variance confirms significant difference (0.05>p=0.0272) in greenhouse gas emissions from the different energy sources. Post-hoc analyses shows a significant difference in emissions between solar and firewood (p<0.0125) and no significant difference between other sources of energy. Sustainability in the tea sector can be achieved through switching to macadamia briquettes as a source of thermal energy and a combination of electricity and solar for electrical energy.\\n   \n",

The growing demand for critical minerals such as lithium and associated water demands in these arid environments has amplified the urgency to address these uncertainties. We present an integrated hydrological analysis of the Dry Andes region utilizing a uniquely comprehensive set of tracer data (3H, 18O/2H) for this type of environment, paired directly with physical hydrological observations. We find two strongly decoupled hydrological systems that interact only under specific hydrogeological conditions where preferential conduits have developed. The primary conditions in these conduits form are when laterally extensive fine-grained evaporite and/or lacustrine units or perennial flowing streams exist in connection with groundwater discharge sites. These conduits which efficiently capture and transport modern or “contemporary” water (weeks to years old) within the system control the interplay between modern hydroclimate variations and groundwater aquifers. Modern waters account for a small portion of basin budgets but are critical to sustaining surface waters due to the existence of these conduits. As a result, surface waters near basin floors are disproportionally sensitive to short-term climate and anthropogenic perturbations. This framework describes a new understanding of the dominant controls on natural water cycles intrinsic to these arid high-elevation systems which improves our ability to manage critical water resources.\\n   \n",

Existing models often assume the availability of comprehensive datasets, an assumption that does not hold true for LICs. This paper introduces a set of innovative frameworks designed to overcome data scarcity by integrating sparse agricultural data, high-resolution climate information, and advanced machine learning techniques. At the core of this approach is a Bayesian hierarchical model that combines satellite-derived climate data with incomplete in-situ agricultural data, enabling probabilistic estimates of productivity in data-limited contexts. The paper also presents a dynamic panel data model to explore long-term interactions between climate and agriculture, capturing sectoral dynamics over extended periods. Additionally, a novel framework for real-time assessment of agricultural productivity loss is introduced, leveraging Bayesian inference to estimate losses based on environmental proxies. These models are intended to improve predictive accuracy and provide practical tools for real-time monitoring and long-term analysis in data-constrained settings, contributing to stronger climate resilience and more informed decision-making in LICs.\\n   \n",

While submesoscale dynamics are known to impact biological fluxes by modifying nutrient upwelling, horizontal transport has traditionally been assumed to only redistribute phytoplankton without altering concentrations. However, variations in submesoscale dispersion may significantly impact total biogeochemical flux if biological reactions occur during dispersal. By parameterizing the effects of dispersion due to lateral stirring on flux, within an eastern boundary current region, we show that enhanced dispersion yields a near-linear increase in offshore flux, with the magnitude modulated by phytoplankton growth rates and ambient nutrient availability. These findings identify a pathway for improving parameterizations of biogeochemical fluxes, while revealing a source of uncertainty in their prediction by climate models.\\n   \n",

The analysis involves detrending weather data by calculating first differences and then computing the cross-correlation function, or CCF with wind power capacity. The calculations are benchmarked using atmospheric CO2 concentration. The consistency of a significant correlation is tested by detrending using linear residuals and then calculating the CCF on the basis of the residuals, corrected for autocorrelation using the Cochrane-Orcutt procedure [4]. In four cases, where the data were reliable, the analysis provided a clear distinction in favour of wind power as a putative cause of the weather trends, in preference to atmospheric CO2 concentration. Where the quality of the data was less reliable, the outcome was inconclusive. Nevertheless, it would seem that our efforts to mitigate anthropogenic global warning with wind power might well be having a deleterious effect on weather patterns\\n   \n",

These Avicennia-only mangroves have been considered impoverished mangroves controlled by the general latitudinal temperature gradient. The MCO Mediterranean mangroves have been compared with the extant Middle East (ME) mangroves around the Arabian Peninsula, characterized by the dominance of Avicennia and their low diversity. However, these extant communities are not a latitudinal feature but rather an anomaly shaped by extreme environmental conditions (aridity, hypersalinity, sediment supply) that only a few mangrove species can tolerate. In contrast, reconstructed environments for MCO Mediterranean mangroves indicate mild, rainy climates. We conclude that current ME mangroves cannot be considered modern analogs for the MCO Mediterranean mangroves. Finding such modern analogs is challenging, and further studies are recommended to uncover their ecological and biogeographical patterns.\\n   \n",

Existing emission scenarios that fail to reflect this transition increasingly diverge from reality. To bridge this gap, we developed an interdisciplinary and multi-model framework that integrates up-to-date emissions inventory and emissions pathway to net zero CO2 by 2060 for China, and then constructed a reality-aligned, sector-specific combined scenario (SSP2-com) for greenhouse gases and air pollutants across global-to-regional, national-to-provincial, and multi-resolution-grid scales. Our emissions pathway sees that global CO₂ will peak in concentration by 2062, and achieve net zero in emissions by 2072. The Asia-Pacific region, particularly China, will lead these reductions through contributions from the energy and industrial sectors. Climate emulators show global temperatures will initially follow SSP2-4.5 but later become more compatible with SSP1-2.6 trends, projected to peak around 2071 and reach a rise of 2.01°C by 2100 (~3.2 W m-2) or for the period 2091-2110, with temperatures falling below 2°C in the first decade after 2100, relevant to the Paris Agreement target. We further propose an evolving SSP2-com+ framework, integrating updated regional and national emission trajectories, to align with commitments more timely and enhance global cooperation. Our findings indicate that balanced, nationally-determined decarbonization efforts can stabilize warming around 2°C without requiring early unprecedented decarbonization rates or large-scale carbon removal efforts. These strategies align more closely with current emission status and national commitments than other existing scenarios, providing a more plausible basis for earth system models.\\n   \n",

A growing number of field studies have linked the change in fire regime to post-fire recruitment failure and permanent forest loss. In this study we used four burnt area and two forest loss datasets to calculate the landscape-scale fire return interval (FRI) and associated risk of permanent forest loss. We then used machine learning to predict how the FRI will change under a high emissions scenario (SSP3-7.0) by the end of the century. We found that there is currently 133 000 km2 at high, or extreme, risk of fire-induced forest loss, with a further 3 M km2 at risk by the end of the century. This has the potential to degrade or destroy some of the largest remaining intact forests in the world, negatively impact the health and economic wellbeing of people living in the region, as well as accelerate global climate change.\\n   \n",

Based on the most widely used Köppen-Geiger scheme, this article proposes a neural network based climate classification method from a data science perspective. In conventional schemes, empirically handcrafted rules are used to divide climate data into climate types, resulting in certain defects. In the proposed method, a machine learning mechanism is employed to do the task. Specifically, the method first trains a convolutional neural network to fit climate data to land cover conditions, then extracts features from the trained network and finally uses a self-organizing map to cluster land pixels on the extracted features. The method is applied to cluster global land represented by 66,501 pixels (each covers 0.5 latitude degree × 0.5 longitude degree) using 2020 land cover data and 1991-2020 climate normals, and a 4 × 3 × 2 hexagonal self-organizing map clusters the land pixels into twenty-four climate types. By Kappa statistics, the obtained scheme shows good agreement with the Köppen-Geiger and Köppen-Trewartha schemes. In addition, our scheme addresses some issues of the Köppen schemes, suggests new climate types such as As (severe dry-wet season) and Fw (arctic desert), and identifies the highland group H without input of elevation. The proposed method is expected as an intelligent tool to monitor changes in the global climate pattern and to discover new climate types of interest that possibly emerge in the future. It may also be valuable for bio-ecology communities.\\n</td>\n",

Fire management agencies require information about near-real time wildfire vulnerability in boreal peatlands. Remote sensing tools (e.g., NDVI, NDII) to monitor changing wildfire vulnerability focus on monitoring changes in vascular vegetation and are not necessarily applicable to moss-dominated peatlands. We use time series analysis of Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data to compare the trends in peatlands that have burned to unburned peatlands and show that the Theil-Sen slopes of seasonally decomposed SAR backscatter reflects prolonged drought conditions that can lead to burning. Seasonally decomposed Sentinel-2 NDVI and NDII were also tested but no statistical differences were found between burned and unburned peatlands. Overall, we found that 6 months prior to a wildfire the slope of seasonally decomposed Sentinel-1 VV SAR backscatter was significantly different in burned and unburned peatlands, and can be used to spatially identify fire vulnerability and identify fire-prone areas.\\n</td>\n",

Although the basic science showing that CO2 would absorb the infrared radiation emitted by the earth produce a surface-warming effect was first calculated by Arrhenius in 1896, the issue was neglected by the scientific community for decades. Today there are ample climate models of the climactic effects arising from the forcing term of increasing P[CO2]. In this paper we follow Arrhenius’ concept, although we use the HITRAN database as the input to prove the connection between earth’s surface temperature and atmospheric absorption of terrestrial radiation in a direct manner that the reader can also implement. The spectra of CO2 are enormously complicated, broadened by Fermi Resonance, and intense because of the quantum coupling of the rotation of CO2 to its bending. Using an on-line database for the transitions of CO2 the reader will easily be able to show that CO2 reduces the transmittance of the Earth’s thermal radiation through the atmosphere, which in turn results in heating of the surface. The model does not make any predictions other than that the global temperature will increase as a function of P[CO2].

These microbes reduce surface albedo, which, in turn, could lead to warming and enhanced glacier melt. Here we present results from a replicated, controlled field experiment to quantify the impact of microbes on snowmelt in red-snow communities. Addition of nitrogen‚Äìphosphorous‚Äìpotassium fertilizer increased alga cell counts nearly fourfold, to levels similar to nitrogen‚Äìphosphorus-enriched lakes; water alone increased counts by half. The manipulated alga abundance explained a third of the observed variability in snowmelt. Using a normalized-difference spectral index we estimated alga abundance from satellite imagery and calculated microbial contribution to snowmelt on an icefield of 1,900 km2. The red-snow area extended over about 700 km2, and in this area we determined that microbial communities were responsible for 17% of the total snowmelt there. Our results support hypotheses that snow-dwelling microbes increase glacier melt directly in a bio-geophysical feedback by lowering albedo and indirectly by exposing low-albedo glacier ice. Radiative forcing due to perennial populations of microbes may match that of non-living particulates at high latitudes.

Although previous studies have shown that regional warming escalates wildfire in the western USA, such an unprecedented fire cannot be explained by climate variability alone. Here we show that the synoptic-scale feedback between the wildfires and weather played an unexpectedly important role in accelerating the spread of this fire and also trapped pollutants in the shallow boundary layer over valley cities. Specifically, we find that aerosol-radiation interaction of the smoke plumes over the Cascade Mountains enhanced the downslope winds and weakened the moisture transport, thereby forming a positive feedback loop that amplified the fires and contributed to ~54% of estimated air-pollution related deaths.

However, none of the current commensuration approaches are suitable for addressing the current climatic effect of mire ecosystems as compared to the situation in which such mires would not exist. The mire ecosystems have accumulated carbon for millennia, creating a negative perturbation to the atmospheric carbon dioxide content, but at the same time they emit methane into the atmosphere. Thus, the functioning of mires involves GHG fluxes with opposing effects on Earth’s radiative balance. Here, based on a simple radiative forcing (RF) model, we propose a new metric for commensuration of the effects of accumulated carbon and methane emission (ACME) on Earth’s energy balance. This ACME approach is applicable to natural mires with a significant part of their carbon accumulated more than 1000 years ago and requires relatively few input data. We demonstrate the feasibility of the ACME approach by applying it to a set of northern mires. The ACME-based RF estimate indicates that these mires have a cooling effect on the current climate, contrary to what a global warming potential-based calculation suggests, since the climatic effect is dominated by the sustained carbon accumulation. By applying the new metric with varying estimates of the total carbon storage and methane emission of northern mires, we estimate the current RF of these mires to range from –0.45 to –0.23 W m-2.\\n</td>\n",

In this study, we make the first compilation of a quasi-climatologic dataset covering 6 years (2015–2020) of hourly near-surface air temperature measurements obtained via 1560 suitable CWS in a domain covering south-east England and Greater London. We investigated the spatio- temporal distribution of urban heat and the influences of local environments on climate, captured by CWS through the scope of Local Climate Zones (LCZ) – a land-use land-cover classification specifically designed for urban climate studies. We further calculate, for the first time, the amount of advected heat captured by CWS located in Greater London and the wider south east England region. We find that London is on average warmer by ∼1.0 ◦C to ∼2.0 ◦C than the rest of south-east England. Characteristics of the southern coastal climate are also captured in the analysis. We find that on average, urban heat advection (UHA) contributes to 0.22 ◦C of the total urban heat in Greater London. Certain areas, mostly in the centre of London are deprived of urban heat through advection since heat is transferred more to downwind suburban areas. UHA can positively contribute to urban heat by up to ∼2.0 ◦C on average and negatively by down to ∼-1.0 ◦C. Our results also show an important degree of inter- and intra-LCZ variability in UHA, calling for more research in the future.

Here we quantify globally how climate driven trade-offs exist between modelled hydrological retention and cooling potential of urban greening. Water retention generally increases with aridity in water limited environments, while cooling potential favors lower aridity, energy limited, climates. Urban greening cannot yield high performance simultaneously for addressing both urban heat-island and urban flooding problems in most cities globally. However, in more arid locations, where sustainable, irrigation might be used to improve potential cooling benefits while maintaining retention performance.

              "      <td>The midlatitude poleward atmospheric energy transport increases in radiatively forced simulations of warmed climates across a range of models from comprehensive coupled general circulation models (GCMs) to idealized aquaplanet moist GCMs to diffusive moist energy balance models. These increases have been rationalized from two perspectives. The energetic (or radiative) perspective takes the atmospheric energy budget and decomposes energy flux changes (radiative forcing, feedbacks, or surface fluxes) to determine the energy transport changes required by the budget. The diffusive perspective takes the net effect of atmospheric macroturbulence to be a diffusive energy transport down-gradient, so transport changes can arise from changes in mean energy gradients or turbulent diffusivity. Here, we compare these perspectives in idealized moist, gray-radiation GCM simulations over a wide range of climates. The energetic perspective has a dominant role for radiative forcing in this GCM, with cancellation between the temperature feedback components that account for the GCM's non-monotonic energy transport changes in response to warming. Comprehensive CMIP5 simulations have similarities in the northern hemisphere to the idealized GCM, though a comprehensive GCM over several CO2 doublings has a distinctly different feedback evolution structure. The diffusive perspective requires a non-constant diffusivity to account for the idealized GCM-simulated changes, with important roles for  the eddy velocity, dry static stability, and horizontal energy gradients. Beyond diagnostic analysis, GCM-independent a priori theories for components of the temperature feedback are presented that account for changes without knowledge of a perturbed climate state, suggesting that the energetic perspective is the more parsimonious one.\\n</td>\n",

Focusing on cleaner cookstoves, we explore the difficulties in using academic studies as benchmarks for evaluations of carbon projects and highlight how methodological choices shape both evaluations and conclusions. Reexamining one influential study on cookstove carbon project overcrediting5, we show that under alternative assumptions consistent with the state of the science estimated overcrediting falls by half. While the overall sector still exhibits worrisome overcrediting, one-fifth of projects analyzed show no clear evidence of it.

It provides time series of electricity demand and supply from wind, solar photovoltaic and hydropower, and can be used for recent trends analysis, seasonal outlooks or the assessment of climate change impacts on energy mixes in the long term. This article introduces this service and the resulting dataset, with a focus on the design and validation of the energy conversion models, based on ENTSO-E energy data and the ERA5 climate reanalysis.

Different zonal wind stress anomalies are employed, and their intensity is strengthened or weakened with respect to the climatological value throughout a suite of simulations.   Strengthened (weakened) zonal wind stress anomalies result in increased (decreased) STCs meridional mass and energy transport. Upwelling of subsurface water into the tropics is intensified (reduced), a distinct cold (warm) anomaly appears in the equatorial thermocline and up to the surface, resulting in significant tropical sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies.   Results hold for both subtropical and extratropical anomalies, suggesting the potential impact of mid-latitude atmospheric modes of variability on tropical climate.  Finally, the remotely-driven response is compared with a set of locally-forced simulations, where an equatorial zonal wind stress anomaly is imposed. A dynamically distinct response is achieved, whereby the equatorial thermocline adjusts to the wind stress anomaly resulting in significant equatorial SST anomalies as in the remotely-forced simulations. Significant anomalies in the Indonesian throughflow are generated only when equatorial wind stress anomalies are applied, leading to remarkable heat content anomalies in the Indian Ocean.  Equatorial wind stress anomalies experiments do not involve modifications of STC transports, but could set up the appropriate initial conditions for a tropical-extratropical teleconnection, involving both Hadley cells and STC anomalous transports.\\n</td>\n",

This article posits that selective science communication and unrealistically optimistic assumptions are obscuring the reality that greenhouse gas emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal will not curtail climate change in the 21st Century. It also explains how overly pessimistic and speculative criticisms are behind opposition to considering potential climate cooling interventions as a complementary approach for mitigating dangerous warming.  There is little evidence supporting assertions that: current greenhouse gas emissions reduction and removal methods can and will be ramped up in time to prevent dangerous climate change; overshoot of Paris Agreement targets will be temporary; net zero emissions will produce a safe, stable climate; the impacts of overshoot can be managed and reversed; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change models and assessments capture the full scope of prospective disastrous impacts; and the risks of climate interventions are greater than the risks of inaction.  These largely unsupported presumptions distort risk assessments and discount the urgent need to develop a viable mitigation strategy. Due to political pressures, many critical scientific concerns are ignored or preemptively dismissed in international negotiations. As a result, the present and growing crisis and the level of effort and time that will be required to control and rebalance the climate are severely underestimated.

Recent developments in the literature of NbS have resulted in a body of work addressing questions about knowledge and justice. In line with these developments, this paper proposes the Knowledge and Epistemic Injustice for NbS for Water Framework (KEIN Framework) to identify the production of epistemic injustices in the design of NbS for water management. The KEIN framework draws on questions about knowledge and power raised by Avelino (2021) and five mechanisms that lead to epistemic injustice based on the work by Fricker (2007) and Byskov (2021). We apply the framework to examine a proposal presented to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) that included NbS for water management and Indigenous Peoples in South America. Rather than being an analysis of the project or the GCF per se, the goal of this analysis is to demonstrate the utility of the framework to analyze proposals during the design stage. We argue that proposals submitted to the GCF are reflective of a broadly held international environmental logic. We also identified indications that knowledge was organized and treated in a way that favored external actors at the expense of local actors.  Our analysis also revealed prejudices against people’s epistemic capacities, with potential implications for how the generation of local knowledge is adopted on the ground. The framework illustrates how the design of NbS may minimally disrupt power relations due to the influential role that some actors have in generating knowledge. This study contributes to the operationalization of epistemic justice in designing NbS. Through the application of the proposed framework, the study contributes to future work advancing the construction of epistemically just NbS.\\n</td>\n",

Despite gaining popularity, studies of various stochastic subgrid scale parameterizations applied to atmospheric climate and weather prediction systems have revealed a diversity of model responses, including degeneracy in the response to different forcings and compensating model errors, with little reduction in artificial damping of the small scales required for numerical stability. Due to the greater range of spatio-temporal scales involved, how to best sample subgrid fluctuations in a computationally inexpensive manner, with the aim of reduced model error and improvements to the simulated climatological state of the ocean, remains an open question. While previous studies have considered perturbations to the surface forcing or subsurface temperature tendencies, we implement an energetically consistent, simple, stochastic subgrid eddy parameterization of the momentum fluxes in regions of the three-dimensional ocean typically associated with high eddy variability.  We consider the changes in the modelled energetics of low-resolution simulations in response to stochastically forced velocity tendencies whose perturbation statistics and amplitudes are calculated from an eddy resolving ocean configuration. Kinetic energy spectra from a triple-decomposition reveal a systematic redistribution from the seasonal (climatological minus mean) potential energy to preferentially generate small scale transient kinetic energy while the total energy spectra remains largely unchanged. We show that stochastic parameterization generally improves model biases, noticeably so for the simulated energetics of the Southern Oceans.\\n</td>\n",

We analyze one authoritative Pleistocene data set to explore how the climate sensitivity parameter S varies under different system states, using linear regression of mean annual surface temperature changes against CO2 forcing changes.  On the whole data set, S = 2.04K/Wm^(-2) and CO2 forcing explains 64% of the variance in temperature.  Partitioning the data by path (glaciation / de-glaciation); during de-glaciation episodes, S = 2.34K/Wm^(-2), explaining 75% of the temperature variance; during glaciations, S = 1.59K/Wm^(-2) explaining 48% of the temperature variance. Further partitioning into epochs before and after the Marine Isotope Stage 11 424 kaBP (thousand years before present); for de-glaciation paths after 424 kaBP, S = 2.63 K/Wm^(-2) explaining 83% of the variance.  Partitioning into levels of CO2 concentration has much less explanatory power; 20% for concentrations above 210 ppmv and 2% for concentrations below 210 ppmv. These partitions conflate glaciation and de-glaciation episodes and pre/post 424 kaBP epochs.  Possible process-related explanations for the path-related differences are conjectured.  The common assumption that changes in temperature are proportional to changes in CO2 forcing constrains the regression intercept to pass through the origin and inflates the regression error to the extent that the regression model becomes a worse predictor of temperature changes than simply predicting the population mean for all values of CO2 forcing. The consequences of this assumption are substantive in the context of estimating future temperature trajectories and should be carefully weighed.\\n</td>\n",

However, the impacts of surface water withdrawal for irrigation and its safe operating space remain unclear. We used field measurements and simulation modeling to investigate the effects of irrigation water withdrawal for Boro rice – the most water-consumptive crop that can be grown by farmers – on river water flow and salinity under different climate change and river flow scenarios. Under the baseline conditions of 2015, about 250,000 ha could potentially be irrigated with river water that has salinity levels below 2 dS/m. The impact on river water salinity would be minimal, and only between 0.71 to 1.12% of the cropland would shift from the 0-2 dS/m class to higher salinity levels. Similarly, a minor change in water flow and salinity was simulated for the moderate climate change scenario (RCP 4.5) that forecasts a sea level rise of 22 cm in 2050. Only under the extreme climate change scenario (RCP 8.5), resulting in a sea level rise of 43 cm by 2050, and low flow conditions that are exceeded in 90 percent of the cases, the 2 dS/m isohaline would move landward by 64 to 105 km in March and April for the Tentulia and Buriswar Rivers. This would expose an additional 36.6% of potentially irrigable cropland to salinity levels of 2 to 4 dS/m.  However, Boro rice is already well established by that time and can tolerate greater levels. We conclude that there is considerable scope to expand irrigated crop production without negatively exposing the cropland and rivers to detrimental salinization levels while preserving the ecosystem services of the rivers.\\n</td>\n",

Results are consistent with the underlying socio-economic storylines of the SSPs, and the resulting out-of-sample armed conflict projections obtained with RandomForest classifiers agree with comparable studies. In SSP1-RCP2.6, conflict risk is low or absent in most regions, although the Horn of Africa and parts of Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique continue to be conflict-prone. Conflict risk intensifies in the more severe SSP3-RCP6.0 scenario, especially in central Africa and large parts of western Africa. We specifically assessed the role of hydro-climatic indicators as drivers of armed conflict. Overall, their importance is limited but can differ locally depending on the overall sign of climate change impact and the contextual (socio-economic) factors defining the overall magnitude of those impacts. With our study being at the forefront of ML applications for conflict risk projections, we have identified various challenges for this arising scientific field. A major concern is the inconsistent data availability of observed conflict events as well as of socio-economic indicators for the various SSPs.

The computer model environment allows us to strictly control for variables such as sea surface temperature (SST), foraminifera species abundance response to SST, as well as depositional processes such as sediment accumulation rate (SAR) and bioturbation depth (BD), and subsequent laboratory processes such as sample size and machine error. Examining a number of best-case scenarios, we find that IFA-derived reconstructions of past SST variability are sensitive to all of the aforementioned variables. Running 100 ensembles for each scenario, we find that the influence of bioturbation upon IFA-derived SST reconstructions, combined with typical samples sizes employed in the field, produces noisy SST reconstructions with poor correlation to the original SST distribution in the water. This noise is especially apparent for values near the edge of the SST distribution, which is the distribution region of particular interest for, e.g., ENSO. The noise is further increased in the case of increasing machine error, decreasing SAR and decreasing sample size. We also find poor agreement between ensembles, underscoring the need for replication studies in the field to confirm findings at particular sites and time periods. Furthermore, we show that a species‚Äô abundance response to SST could in theory bias IFA-derived SST reconstructions, which can have consequences when comparing IFA-derived SST from markedly different mean climate states.

Several land-use change models exist that allocate coarse land-use changes at finer spatial scales, but there is no general, global, computationally tractable tool for downscaling to the spatial scale appropriate for understanding landscape and ecosystem change across different land-system scenarios. Here, we present a new model, the Spatial Economic Allocation Landscape Simulator (SEALS), which generates global, high resolution land-use, land-cover maps from coarse projections of land-use change. SEALS advances land-use change modeling research in several ways: it uses a novel machine-learning algorithm to empirically calibrate its parameters; it is a generalized approach that can be applied to very different types of projections within earth-economy models; and it is computationally efficient, generating global results at 300m resolution in approximately 1 hour on a laptop computer. We develop SEALS, and apply it to downscale 6 global scenarios of land-use change from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to 300m resolution, which we make publicly available, allowing researchers to project global, fine-scale changes in ecosystem services.

At the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD; northeastern Alberta, Canada), an internationally recognized remote freshwater landscape threatened by climate change and upstream industrial development (hydroelectric regulation of river flow, oil sands mining and processing), the need for an integrated aquatic ecosystem monitoring program has long been recognized to track changes to the flood regime, water balance, water quality, and contaminant deposition in the abundant shallow lakes. The remoteness and hydrological complexity of the landscape, among other factors, have hindered the implementation of such a program.

Using reanalysis and two large-ensemble datasets from CESM1 and GFDL-CM3, we investigate the following: The climatology of 3D structure, physical processes governing the temperature anomaly associated with blocks, ability of GCMs to reproduce the 3D structure, and its response to RCP8.5. In reanalysis, over both ocean and land, the anomalous winds are equivalent-barotropic in the troposphere and stratosphere, and temperature anomalies are positive throughout the troposphere and negative in the lower stratosphere. The main seasonal and regional differences are that blocks are larger/stronger in winters, and over oceans, the temperature anomaly is shifted westward due to latent heating. Analyzing the temperature tendency equation shows that in all three sectors, adiabatic warming due to subsidence is the main driver of the positive temperature anomaly; however, depending on season and region, meridional thermal advection and latent heating might have leading-order contributions too. Both GCMs are found to reproduce the climatological 3D structure remarkably well, but sometimes disagree on future changes. Overall, the future summertime response is weakening of all fields (except for specific humidity), although the impact on near-surface temperature is not necessarily weakened; e.g., the blocking-driven near-surface warming over Russia intensifies. The wintertime response is strengthening of all fields, except for temperature in some cases. Responses of geopotential height and temperature are shifted westward in winters, most likely due to latent heating.\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>Earth scientists have a critical role to play in communicating to the public and policy makers what we know about looming societal threats including climate change, extreme natural events, resource conflicts and the energy transition. But whilst geoscientists are being encouraged - and, increasingly, trained - to ‘go public’ with our science, what is less clear is to what extent our current geo-communications are effectively addressing the long-term planetary concerns that confront society.  In this paper we argue that scientists are the interface between the research organisations that produce knowledge and the wider public who could use that knowledge, and, in that regard, are akin to marketers in the business world. Drawing from the dominant paradigms that shape business marketing, we re-consider the prevailing models of science communication and their consequent sense of purpose. We identify three dominant approaches of marketing-led science communication: ‘make-and-sell’; ‘sense-and-respond’; and ‘guide-and-co-create’. We judge the first two to be incompatible with delivering long-term sustainability, in contrast to the emergent guide-and-co-create mode - purpose-driven, interdisciplinary, participatory, and reflexive - which we contend is best placed to tackle long-term geo-environmental concerns through having a clear wellbeing- focused objective whilst co-creating the path to achieving it.  We conclude with the contention that adopting a guide-and-co-create approach to science communications will require not only rethinking communication practice within universities but also radical institutional regime change towards universities becoming purpose-driven organisations.\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>Coral reefs may provide a beneficial first line of defence against tsunami hazards, though this is currently debated. Using a fully nonlinear, Boussinesq propagation model, we examine the buffering capacity of the Great Barrier Reef against tsunamis triggered by several hypothetical sources: a series of far-field, Solomon Islands earthquake sources of various magnitudes (Mw 8.0, Mw 8.5, and Mw 9.0), a submarine landslide source that has previously been documented in the offshore geological record (i.e. the Gloria Knolls Slide), and a potential future landslide source (i.e. the Noggin Block). We show that overall, the Great Barrier Reef acts as a large-scale regional buffer due to the roughness of coral cover and the complex bathymetric features (i.e. platforms, shoals, terraces, etc.) that corals construct over thousands of years. However, the buffering effect of coral cover is much stronger for tsunamis that are higher in amplitude. When coral cover is removed, the largest earthquake scenario (Mw 9.0) exhibits up to a 31% increase in offshore wave amplitude and estimated run-up. These metrics increase even more for landslide scenarios, where they tend to double. These discrepancies can be explained by the higher bed particle velocities incited by higher-amplitude waves, which leads to greater frictional dissipation at a seabed covered by coral. At a site-specific level, shoreline orientation relative to the reef platforms also determines the degree of protectiveness against both types of tsunamis, where areas situated behind broad, shallow, coral-covered platforms benefit the most. Additionally, we find that the platforms, rather than gaps in the offshore reef structure, tend to amplify wave trains through wave focussing when coral cover is removed from simulations. Our findings have implications for future tsunami hazards along the northeastern Australian coastline, particularly as the physiological stressors imposed by anthropogenic climate change further exacerbate coral die-off and reductions in ecosystem complexity. Therefore, areas that experience a protective benefit by the Great Barrier Reef‚Äôs platforms could be disproportionately more vulnerable in the future.\\n</td>\n",

The ClimHB conceptual framework, developed in 2019, integrates two influential models: the Levesque model of healthcare access and DFID's resilience framework. Designed to study health system resilience in response to climate-induced events, the ClimHB framework uniquely positions the population as an active participant on the demand side, complementing the supply side of health services and providers. Characterised by three core dimensions – exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity – this dual focus on demand and supply, and their interactions emphasises the dynamic interplay between both sides in shaping health system resilience. A workshop utilising framework analysis, and the World Café method refined the ClimHB framework by integrating empirical evidence from Haiti and Bangladesh, alongside insights from a literature review. The revised framework presents a dynamic understanding of interrelated resilience, aimed at informing decision-making across all levels of healthcare. It emphasises the importance of contextual factors, strengthens outcome linkages, and incorporates socio-economic and ecological considerations. Governance, professional awareness, and supply-side feedback loops were also emphasised. Site studies demonstrated the framework’s adaptability and ability to foster synergy between theory and implementation. However, challenges persist in operationalising the framework, particularly for policymakers, emphasising the need for validation, standardised measures, and a deeper understanding of resilience interplays. Future research should explore the framework’s implications for structural management, training, and resource allocation, addressing critical gaps in resilience research.\\n</td>\n",

The Choco low-level jet is emblematic of broader westerly winds in this region and is projected to weaken by the end of the 21st century, but climate models show considerable disagreement about the extent of weakening. Using contemporary observations, we demonstrate that the configuration of westerly winds in the eastern equatorial Pacific is reflected by hydrogen isotopes in precipitation (Œ¥Dp ) in Ecuador. As westerly winds strengthen, Œ¥D p increases from greater transport of enriched Œ¥D vapor from the Eastern Pacific Warm Pool. We apply this framework to a new record of reconstructed Œ¥Dp using leaf waxes in ocean sediments off the coast of Ecuador (ODP1239, 0 ‚ó¶ 40.32 0 S, 82 ‚ó¶ 4.86 0 W) that span the Plio-Pleistocene. Low Œ¥D p in the early Pliocene indicates weak westerly water vapor transport in a warmer climate state, which is attributed to a low sea surface temperature gradient between the cold tongue and off-equatorial regions in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Near the end-Pliocene (Àú3 Ma), westerly water vapor transport weakens, possibly from shifts in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, forced by high latitude Northern Hemisphere cooling. In complementary isotope-enabled climate simulations, a weak Choco jet and westerly water vapor transport in the early Pliocene are matched by a decrease in Œ¥D p and hydroclimate changes in the northern tropical Andes. Precipitation from the Choco jet can cause deadly landslides and weakened westerly winds in the early Pliocene implies a southward shift of these hazards along the Pacific coast of the northern tropical Andes in the future.\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>Climate change influences both average states and extremes in temperatures and precipitation. Southeast Asia, one of the most vulnerable regions worldwide to floods and heatwaves, indicates an escalation of the possibility of severe climate extremes. Extreme precipitation events can bring increasing floods, leading to considerable damage to property and human well-being. However, droughts also occur in Southeast Asia due to changing precipitation patterns in different regions. In big cities, such damages and risks are highly influential, given the large population density and the proximity to the coast or rivers. Global Earth system models predict the average trends and extremes of the climate system, including record-shattering extreme events that have exceeded previous records. I use the recently released Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), a multi-model large ensemble of climate predictions under different scenarios, to investigate changes in climate conditions in ten highly populated Southeast Asian cities. I first evaluated the CMIP6 simulations in the present day (2005-2014) in the ten cities and found good consistency in temperature and precipitation. Then, I examine changes in the mean, minimum, and maximum temperature and precipitation on an annual, monthly, and daily basis, respectively, under the high-emission SSP5-8.5 scenario. Furthermore, in the late century, annual maximum temperatures hit more than 40 °C in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and Vientiane. Cities in our study are projected to experience 5-6 °C increases in temperature from November to April, indicating significant changes in the seasonal cycle. Precipitation increases significantly from May to October in most large cities in our study, except for Johor Bahru, Malaysia, where some summer precipitation reductions are expected. Yangon, in particular, is projected to increase more than 4 millimeters per day in July, indicating a very high challenge from flooding as a city facing flood risk every year at present. In summary, our results indicate significant changes in the mean and extreme states of temperature and precipitations in Southeast Asia. Based on these, I identified major physical risks of climate change among the ten cities. Decision-makers should build resilience to these risks to avoid significant damage. Yukiko Hirabayashi et al. (2013) discovered that the risks of floods increase due to the degree of warming. Increasing floods might lead to damage to households and other organisms. Moreover, a greater incidence of climate change, such as droughts, in Southeast Asia is caused by decreasing precipitation in regions (Teerachai Amnuaylojaroen and Pavinee Chanvichit (2019)). This investigation particularly utilizes CMIP6 model simulations to predict the future pattern of climate extremes based on historical and present statistics. CMIP6 performs well in reproducing the climatological spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation, with better performance for temperature than precipitation to predict near future and future climate extremes is that it (Yang et al. for China). With large-ensemble data for climate extremes, CMIP6 can predict more precise climate extremes. This model is necessary for research about extreme climate, as it addresses the climate system's natural variability in different regions with different topographic features.\\n</td>\n",

We explored the combined effects of past and future changes in air temperature and precipitation amount and distribution on the evolution of Khumbu Glacier in the Everest region of Nepal—a benchmark glacier in the monsoon-influenced Nepal Himalaya—using a climate-glacier modelling approach that forces an ice-dynamical glacier evolution model with a surface mass balance forcing that includes mesoscale meteorological variables derived from downscaling of Regional Climate Model outputs. Our simulations show that historical warming during the late Holocene has committed Khumbu Glacier to future volume loss of 10–23% during this century. Under moderate future warming (RCP4.5) from the present day, Khumbu Glacier could lose 70% volume by 2100 CE due to increasing air temperatures. However, the projected increase in precipitation in tandem with climate warming could offset half of this loss, such that the total decrease in glacier volume by 2100 CE compared to the present day is only 34%.

The most common method for determining spatial wind speed patterns in cities relies on numerical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, which resolve Navier-Stokes equations around buildings. While effective, these simulations are computationally intensive and require specialised expertise, limiting their broader applicability. To address these limitations, this study proposes a more cost-effective alternative while maintaining the accuracy and spatial patterns captured by CFD. We developed a machine learning (ML) approach to predict wind speed patterns from prevailing wind directions and three- dimensional urban morphology, which are increasingly available for global cities. The model is trained and tested using a comprehensive dataset of 512 numerical simulations of urban neighbourhoods, representing diverse morphological configurations in cities worldwide. We find that the ML algorithm accurately predicts complex wind patterns, achieving a normalised mean absolute error of less than 10%, which is comparable to wind anemometer measurement in a low wind speed environment. In predicting wind statistics, the ML model also surpasses that of regression models based solely on statistical representations of urban morphology. The R2 values measuring grid-level agreement between ML and CFD range from 0.94-0.99 and 0.65-0.95, respectively, for the idealised and whole datasets. However, we find that grid-based R2 is not an effective metric for evaluating the 2D model performance due to localised biases arising from faster wind speed grid regions, which is revealed by the wind probability density function. This further confirms the suitability of the ML models for capturing wind distributions at pedestrian height. These findings demonstrate that complex pedestrian wind patterns can be effectively predicted using an image-based ML approach, circumventing the need to resolve complex physical equations directly.\\n</td>\n",

The methodology involved downloading relevant papers, identifying and categorizing the machine learning algorithms employed, and quantifying their use. Geological and climatic variables were also identified, analyzed and categorized to measure their usage frequency. The different algorithms and input variables extracted from each paper are graphically represented in this document highlighting the most employed ones. The findings suggest that the available literature on this topic in Africa is limited compared to the rest of the world. Tree-based algorithms are commonly used in machine learning in Africa, and the most employed input variables are related to geomorphology and temperature. The study highlights the potential of machine learning in improving water resource management and decision-making in the region.\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>Climate change is very crucial for ecological systems and society. But Global climate models run at coarse spatial resolution which is difficult to do regional analysis. Regional-scale projections can be obtained by a technique called statistical downscaling which uses past data to find out the high resolution and low-resolution mapping. There are many methods for statistical downscaling of climate data: 1) Conventional methods 2) Deep learning architecture. Some of the existing works like DeepSd downscaled High-resolution climate projections but in such cases, Global climate model (GCM) data suffers from concept drift, change of mapping between input and label over time. So applying these deep learning models is not a good idea for statistical downscaling. In our study, we have developed new approach of downscaling which outperforms other deep learning architectures like super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN), Long short term memory network (LSTM) in terms of accuracy and reliability. These existing models focus on minimizing the root mean square error (RMSE ) and do not take care of the tails or extremes. Therefore the objective function of these models should be changed other than root mean square error (RMSE). Our proposed model focuses on both means and extremes. We provide a comparison between proposed and other existing deep learning models in downscaling daily precipitation and temperature from 1.25 to 0.25 resolution over India. We have downscaled 6 Global climate model (GCM) models in our comparative study.\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>In hydrology and water resources management, scenario-neutral methods are already common, mostly used to rapidly compare system responses to plausible changes in climate. As a first application in glaciology, a scenario-neutral approach, using climatic mass balance as a system response, is applied to four glaciers: Hintereisferner (AT), Peyto Glacier (CA), Austre Br√∏ggerbreen (NO) and Abramov Glacier (KGZ). The Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM) is used to perform a scenario-neutral glacier sensitivity analysis, resulting in visual, two-dimensional response surfaces, and a glacier sensitivity index (GSI). In addition, four Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models (CMIP6) (FGOALS3, MPI-ESM1, EG-Earth 3, NorESM2), under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) (1-2.6, 2-4.5, 3-7.0, 5-8.5) are overlaid, for comparison. Assessing results shows that overall, Hintereisferner is most sensitive to changes in climate overall, and temperature especially, with a temperature GSI of 1.12 m w.e./¬∞C - 1.96 m w.e./¬∞C, versus, for example, a temperature GSI of 0.56 m w.e./¬∞C - 0.81 m w.e./¬∞C for Peyto glacier. Seasonally, we see differences in sensitivity between climatic variables and glaciers, too. Overlaying time slices of the CMIP6 models emphasizes how scenario-neutral approaches are suitable for use in glacier modelling, especially as a framework for sensitivity studies.\\n</td>\n",

However, future drought changes in Australia ‚Äìthe driest inhabited continent on Earth‚Äì have remained stubbornly uncertain due to a lack of model agreement in projected precipitation changes in most regions. We use an ensemble of future projections from the National Hydrological Projections to assess future drought changes in Australia. The ensemble of 32 simulations was created using the Australian Landscape Water Balance model (AWRA-L) forced by four global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 that were downscaled and bias-corrected using four alternative methods. This ensemble provided an opportunity to analyse multiple sources of uncertainty on the future projections and quantify changes across multiple drought types (meteorological, hydrological and agricultural). We show future increases in the time spent under drought for all three drought types, with largest increases projected in winter and spring. The future changes are particularly robust in the highly populated and agricultural regions of Australia, suggesting potential impacts on agricultural activities, ecosystems and urban water supply. We attributed uncertainty in future drought changes to GCMs, downscaling/bias correction methods and emissions scenarios. GCMs represent the largest source of uncertainty but the choice of downscaling method is also important. The emissions scenarios were the lowest source of uncertainty but influenced the magnitude and spatial extent of robust future changes. Overall, the projections suggest likely future increases in drought in Australia with little evidence for ameliorating drought risk with climate change despite ongoing uncertainty in future changes in parts of the country.\\n</td>\n",

Glacier area is an essential climate variable but its tracking is complicated by the labour-intensive manual digitisation of satellite imagery. Here we introduce ICEmapper, a deep learning model that maps glacier outlines from Sentinel-1 time series with accuracy on par with human experts. We used this model to retrieve Svalbard glacier outlines for 2016‚Äì2024 and found a tripling of the glacier area loss rate (-260 km2 p.a.) in the last decade as compared to that previously reported for 1980‚Äì2010 (-80 km2 p.a.). This acceleration is largely driven by increased calving at tidewater glaciers and the climatic warming signal impacting land-terminating glaciers. Additionally, our analysis shows significant area changes related to glacier surging, namely, the Nathorstbreen system and Austfonna, Basin-3 surges. These two surges collectively added to the area change in 2006‚Äì2016 (+194.30 km2 or +0.59%), thus delaying the regionwide area loss by approximately two years. Our results indicate a significant acceleration in glacier area loss in Svalbard, and we anticipate broader applications of our method to track glacier changes on larger scales.\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>We present Interferometric Synthetic Aperture data spanning a series of precipitation events that impacted the southern edge of the Arabian Peninsula in 2017-2018.  The arid climate, sparse vegetation and low topographic relief result in very high interferometric coherence magnitude between most pairs of dates, even for those separated by multiple years. For pairs of dates with differing soil moisture conditions, such as a “dry” date and a date immediately following one of the precipitation events, the interferometric coherence magnitude is much lower.  However, pairs spanning the same event, but with a longer time interval, have high interferometric coherence magnitude.  This observation suggests that the phase changes that result in lower coherence for some pairs are not permanent, such as those that would result from erosion or deposition of material, but are due to the variations in soil moisture.   In support of this view, when we compare the phase of individual pixels to their neighbors, we observe similar phase change trends for each precipitation event. We present a simple statistical model of the relationship between soil moisture and phase, and show that it predicts the observed coherence and phase histories within this particular SAR time series.  We also show how the parameters of this relationship can be inferred from the InSAR observables, and can be used to reduce the soil moisture effects on coherence and phase even for pairs of dates that were not used in that parameter estimation.  For the test data considered here, the noise associated with soil moisture is lowered by 40%. We present results for synthetic time series, including a demonstration of the widely-observed phenomenon that displacement rates inferred from InSAR time series depend on the choice of interferometric pairs used in the analysis.\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>The Arctic Ocean is strongly stratified by salinity in the uppermost layers. This stratification is a key attribute of the region as it acts as an effective barrier for the vertical exchanges of Atlantic Water heat, nutrients, and CO2 between intermediate depths and the surface of the Eurasian and Amerasian basins (EB and AB). Observations show that from 1970 to 2017, the stratification in the AB has strengthened, whereas, in parts of the EB, the stratification has weakened. The strengthening in the AB is linked to freshening and deepening of the halocline. In the EB, the weakened stratification is associated with salinification and shoaling of the halocline (Atlantification). Simulations from a suite of CMIP6 models project that, under a strong greenhouse-gas forcing scenario (ssp585), the overall surface freshening and warming continue in both basins, but there is a divergence in hydrographic trends in certain regions. Within the AB, there is agreement among the models that the upper layers will become more stratified. However, within the EB, models diverge regarding future stratification. This is due to different balances between trends at the surface and trends at depth, related to Fram Strait fluxes. The divergence affects projections of future state of Arctic sea ice, as models with the strongest Atlantification project the strongest decline in sea ice volume in the EB. From these simulations, one could conclude that Atlantificaton will not spread eastward into the AB; however, we need to improve models to simulate tendencies in a more delicately stratified EB correctly.\\n</td>\n",

However, extensive amount of energy is required to produce one kilogram of tea, making tea processing energy-intensive. Comparing greenhouse gas emissions from different types of energy consumed in tea factories is imperative to enable policymakers make informed intervention in emission reduction. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in tea factories is one of the pathways to meeting Kenya’s nationally determined 32% reduction of carbon emissions by 2030 and commitment to the Paris Agreement. This paper assesses greenhouse gas emissions from different sources of energy used in four tea factories in Kenya. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission factor is used to calculate the total emissions of each type of energy used for 5 years. Life cycle assessment using simapro software is used to assess the specific compound causing the emission. The findings reveal that the 5-year greenhouse gas emissions by biogas, solar, wood, briquettes, and electricity are 336,111, 7,108, 20,201.06, and 1,338.28 kg CO2/kWh, respectively. Firewood has the highest concentration of carbon dioxide, while solar energy has the least. Analysis of variance confirms significant difference (0.05&gt;p=0.0272) in greenhouse gas emissions from the different energy sources. Post-hoc analyses shows a significant difference in emissions between solar and firewood (p&lt;0.0125) and no significant difference between other sources of energy. Sustainability in the tea sector can be achieved through switching to macadamia briquettes as a source of thermal energy and a combination of electricity and solar for electrical energy.\\n</td>\n",

The growing demand for critical minerals such as lithium and associated water demands in these arid environments has amplified the urgency to address these uncertainties. We present an integrated hydrological analysis of the Dry Andes region utilizing a uniquely comprehensive set of tracer data (3H, 18O/2H) for this type of environment, paired directly with physical hydrological observations. We find two strongly decoupled hydrological systems that interact only under specific hydrogeological conditions where preferential conduits have developed. The primary conditions in these conduits form are when laterally extensive fine-grained evaporite and/or lacustrine units or perennial flowing streams exist in connection with groundwater discharge sites. These conduits which efficiently capture and transport modern or “contemporary” water (weeks to years old) within the system control the interplay between modern hydroclimate variations and groundwater aquifers. Modern waters account for a small portion of basin budgets but are critical to sustaining surface waters due to the existence of these conduits. As a result, surface waters near basin floors are disproportionally sensitive to short-term climate and anthropogenic perturbations. This framework describes a new understanding of the dominant controls on natural water cycles intrinsic to these arid high-elevation systems which improves our ability to manage critical water resources.\\n</td>\n",

Existing models often assume the availability of comprehensive datasets, an assumption that does not hold true for LICs. This paper introduces a set of innovative frameworks designed to overcome data scarcity by integrating sparse agricultural data, high-resolution climate information, and advanced machine learning techniques. At the core of this approach is a Bayesian hierarchical model that combines satellite-derived climate data with incomplete in-situ agricultural data, enabling probabilistic estimates of productivity in data-limited contexts. The paper also presents a dynamic panel data model to explore long-term interactions between climate and agriculture, capturing sectoral dynamics over extended periods. Additionally, a novel framework for real-time assessment of agricultural productivity loss is introduced, leveraging Bayesian inference to estimate losses based on environmental proxies. These models are intended to improve predictive accuracy and provide practical tools for real-time monitoring and long-term analysis in data-constrained settings, contributing to stronger climate resilience and more informed decision-making in LICs.\\n</td>\n",

While submesoscale dynamics are known to impact biological fluxes by modifying nutrient upwelling, horizontal transport has traditionally been assumed to only redistribute phytoplankton without altering concentrations. However, variations in submesoscale dispersion may significantly impact total biogeochemical flux if biological reactions occur during dispersal. By parameterizing the effects of dispersion due to lateral stirring on flux, within an eastern boundary current region, we show that enhanced dispersion yields a near-linear increase in offshore flux, with the magnitude modulated by phytoplankton growth rates and ambient nutrient availability. These findings identify a pathway for improving parameterizations of biogeochemical fluxes, while revealing a source of uncertainty in their prediction by climate models.\\n</td>\n",

The analysis involves detrending weather data by calculating first differences and then computing the cross-correlation function, or CCF with wind power capacity. The calculations are benchmarked using atmospheric CO2 concentration. The consistency of a significant correlation is tested by detrending using linear residuals and then calculating the CCF on the basis of the residuals, corrected for autocorrelation using the Cochrane-Orcutt procedure [4]. In four cases, where the data were reliable, the analysis provided a clear distinction in favour of wind power as a putative cause of the weather trends, in preference to atmospheric CO2 concentration. Where the quality of the data was less reliable, the outcome was inconclusive.

Existing emission scenarios that fail to reflect this transition increasingly diverge from reality. To bridge this gap, we developed an interdisciplinary and multi-model framework that integrates up-to-date emissions inventory and emissions pathway to net zero CO2 by 2060 for China, and then constructed a reality-aligned, sector-specific combined scenario (SSP2-com) for greenhouse gases and air pollutants across global-to-regional, national-to-provincial, and multi-resolution-grid scales. Our emissions pathway sees that global CO₂ will peak in concentration by 2062, and achieve net zero in emissions by 2072. The Asia-Pacific region, particularly China, will lead these reductions through contributions from the energy and industrial sectors. Climate emulators show global temperatures will initially follow SSP2-4.5 but later become more compatible with SSP1-2.6 trends, projected to peak around 2071 and reach a rise of 2.01°C by 2100 (~3.2 W m-2) or for the period 2091-2110, with temperatures falling below 2°C in the first decade after 2100, relevant to the Paris Agreement target. We further propose an evolving SSP2-com+ framework, integrating updated regional and national emission trajectories, to align with commitments more timely and enhance global cooperation. Our findings indicate that balanced, nationally-determined decarbonization efforts can stabilize warming around 2°C without requiring early unprecedented decarbonization rates or large-scale carbon removal efforts.

Based on the most widely used K\\u00f6ppen-Geiger scheme, this article proposes a neural network based climate classification method from a data science perspective. In conventional schemes, empirically handcrafted rules are used to divide climate data into climate types, resulting in certain defects. In the proposed method, a machine learning mechanism is employed to do the task. Specifically, the method first trains a convolutional neural network to fit climate data to land cover conditions, then extracts features from the trained network and finally uses a self-organizing map to cluster land pixels on the extracted features. The method is applied to cluster global land represented by 66,501 pixels (each covers 0.5 latitude degree \\u00d7 0.5 longitude degree) using 2020 land cover data and 1991-2020 climate normals, and a 4 \\u00d7 3 \\u00d7 2 hexagonal self-organizing map clusters the land pixels into twenty-four climate types. By Kappa statistics, the obtained scheme shows good agreement with the K\\u00f6ppen-Geiger and K\\u00f6ppen-Trewartha schemes. In addition, our scheme addresses some issues of the K\\u00f6ppen schemes, suggests new climate types such as As (severe dry-wet season) and Fw (arctic desert), and identifies the highland group H without input of elevation. The proposed method is expected as an intelligent tool to monitor changes in the global climate pattern and to discover new climate types of interest that possibly emerge in the future. It may also be valuable for bio-ecology communities.\\n\",\n          \"Adaptive management has become the preferred approach for managing environmental flows globally, and successful implementation recognizes multiple dimensions of variability and complexity in socio-ecological systems.  This paper outlines an environmental flow assessment methodology that explicitly addresses the uncertainty and change inherent in adaptively managing multiple values for management of environmental flows. While non-stationarity and uncertainty are well recognised in the climate literature, these have not been addressed within the structure of environmental flows methodologies. Here, we present an environmental flow assessment that is structured to explicitly consider future change and uncertainty in climate and socio-ecological values, by examining scenarios using ecological models. The environmental flow assessment methodology further supports adaptive management through the intentional integration of participatory approaches and the inclusion of diverse stakeholders. We present a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, highlighting how this methodology facilitates adaptive management. Rethinking our approach to environmental flows assessments is an important step in ensuring that environmental flows continue to work effectively as a management tool under climate change.\\n\",\n          \"Solar geoengineering describes a set of proposals to deliberately alter the earth\\u201a\\u00c4\\u00f4s radiative balance to reduce climate risks. We elicit judgements on natural science research priorities for solar geoengineering through a survey and in-person discussion with 72 subject matter experts, including two thirds of all scientists with \\u201a\\u00e2\\u202210 publications on the topic. Experts prioritized Earth system response (33%) and impacts on society and ecosystems (27%) over the human and social dimensions (17%) and developing or improving solar geoengineering methods (15%), with most allocating no effort to weather control or counter-geoengineering. While almost all funding to date has focused on geophysical modeling and social sciences, our experts recommended substantial funding for observations (26%), perturbative field experiments (16%), laboratory research (11%) and engineering for deployment (11%). Of the specific proposals, stratospheric aerosols received the highest average priority (34%) then marine cloud brightening (17%) and cirrus cloud thinning (10%). The views of experts with \\u201a\\u00e2\\u202210 publications were generally consistent with experts with <10 publications, though when asked to choose the radiative forcing for their ideal climate scenario only 40% included solar geoengineering compared to 70% of experts with <10 publications. This suggests that those who have done more solar geoengineering research are less supportive of its use in climate policy. We summarize specific research recommendations and challenges that our experts identified, the most salient of which were fundamental uncertainties around key climate processes, novel challenges related to solar geoengineering as a design problem, and the challenges of public and policymaker engagement.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Correct\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Since these dense features are from a model trained with a much bigger and general set of training data, they might also capture more ambiguity that lies in a hidden latent space between our 4 set categories, thus making classification more difficult.\n",

        "Our model showed strongest performance in predicting Evidential abstracts. However, there was a lot of challenge in distinguishing neighboring categories (e.g., Definitive and Evidential; Hypothetical and Exploratory). Texts with Definitive labels were often misclassified as Exploratory, while Exploratory was often mistaken for Hypothetical or Definitive. In many of our data, certainty levels are not always distinctive, and are more like a spectrum than a distinct category, which may have caused the model to learn the clean decision boundaries.\n",

        "The use of keywords that denotes certainty or uncertainty may skew the model. We are simply using counts of these words, which might cause the model to trust in a label based on the presence of these words too much. The true nature of these labels are more subtle than just the absence of presence of these words. Also the progression from exploratory to definitive, though ordinal, may have blurry boundaries when it pertains to which of these categories begins to denote certainty (for example, while we know Definitive should denote certainty, should Evidential as well?).\n",

This could impact the model since 193/500 is about 40%, so the model could achieve 40% accuracy just by guessing Evidential. Our dataset is a good candidate for strategies like oversampling and changing class weights. Accounting for class imbalance by changing class weights improved our accuracy by 2%, and we did not try using oversampling since there is no one class that is so rare compared to others that warrant the use of oversampling.   \n"
